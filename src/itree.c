/*
   Intervals of the form [BEGIN, END), are stored as nodes inside a RB
   tree, ordered by BEGIN.  The core operation of this tree (besides
   insert, remove, etc.) is finding all intervals intersecting with
   some given interval.  In order to perform this operation
   efficiently, every node stores a third value called LIMIT. (See
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree#Augmented_tree and its
   source Introduction to Algorithms, Cormen et al. .)

   ==== Finding intervals ====

   If we search for all intervals intersecting with (X, Y], we look at
   some node and test whether

   NODE.BEGIN > Y

   Due to the invariant of the search tree, we know, that we may
   safely prune NODE's right subtree if this test succeeds, since all
   intervals begin strictly after Y.

   But we can not make such an assumptions about the left tree, since
   all we know is that the intervals in this subtree must start before
   or at NODE.BEGIN.  So we can't tell, whether they end before X or
   not.  To solve this problem we add another attribute to each node,
   called LIMIT.

   The LIMIT of a node is the largest END value occurring in the nodes
   subtree (including the node itself).  Thus, we may look at the left
   child of some NODE and test whether

   NODE.left.LIMIT < X

   and this tells us, if all intervals in the left subtree of NODE end
   before X and if they can be pruned.

   Conversely, if this inequality is false, the left subtree must
   contain at least one intersecting interval, giving a resulting time
   complexity of O(K*log(N)) for this operation, where K is the size
   of the result set and N the size of the tree.

   ==== FIXME: bug#58342 some important operations remain slow ===

   The amortized costs of Emacs' previous-overlay-change and
   next-overlay-change functions are O(N) with this data structure.
   The root problem is that we only have an order for the BEG field,
   but not the END.  The previous/next overlay change operations need
   to find the nearest point where there is *either* an interval BEG
   or END point, but there is no efficient way to narrow the search
   space over END postions.

   Consider the case where next-overlay-change is called at POS, all
   interval BEG positions are less than pos POS and all interval END
   posistions are after.  These END positions have no order, and so
   *every* interval must be examined.  This is at least O(N).  The
   previous-overlay-change case is similar.  The root issue is that
   the iterative "narrowing" approach is not guaranteed to reduce the
   search space in logarithmic time, since END is not ordered in the
   tree.

   One might argue that the LIMIT value will do this narrowing, but
   this narrowing is O(K*log(N)) where K is the size of the result
   set.  If we are interested in finding the node in a range with the
   smallest END, we might have to examine all K nodes in that range.
   In the case of the *-overlay-channge functions, K may well be equal
   to N.

   Ideally, a tree based data structure for overlays would have
   O(log(N)) performance for previous-overlay-change and
   next-overlay-change, as these are called in performance sensitive
   situations such as redisplay.  The only way I can think of
   achieving this is by keeping one ordering by BEG and a separate
   ordering by END, and then performing logic quite similar to the
   current Emacs overlays-before and overlays-after lists.

   ==== Adjusting intervals ====

   Since this data-structure will be used for overlays in an Emacs
   buffer, a second core operation is the ability to insert and delete
   gaps in the tree.  This models the insertion and deletion of text
   in a buffer and the effects it may have on the positions of
   overlays.

   Consider this: Something gets inserted at position P into a buffer
   and assume that all overlays occur strictly after P.  Ordinarily,
   we would have to iterate all overlays and increment their BEGIN and
   END values accordingly (the insertion of text pushes them back).
   In order to avoid this, we introduce yet another node attribute,
   called OFFSET.

   The OFFSET of some some subtree, represented by its root, is the
   amount of shift that needs to be applied to its BEGIN, END and
   LIMIT values, in order to get to the actual buffer positions.
   Coming back to the example, all we would need to do in this case,
   is to increment the OFFSET of the tree's root, without any
   traversal of the tree itself.

   As a consequence, the real values of BEGIN, END and LIMIT of some
   NODE need to be computed by incrementing them by the sum of NODE's
   OFFSET and all of its ancestors offsets.  Therefore, we store a
   counter (otick) inside every node and also the tree, by which we
   remember the fact, that a node's path to the root has no offsets
   applied (i.e. its values are up to date).  This is the case if some
   node's value differs from the tree's one, the later of which is
   incremented whenever some node's offset has changed.  */
