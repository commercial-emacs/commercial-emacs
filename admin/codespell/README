This directory contains supporting files for running codespell.
See the ./admin/run-codespell script.

codespell.dictionary

    This file contains additional, Emacs-specific corrections.  When
    fixing typos in Emacs, consider adding them to this file.

codespell.exclude

    This file contains lines that are correct and should be ignored by
    codespell.  Add any false positives to this file.

    The lines must match lines in the Emacs source tree exactly,
    including any whitespace.

codespell.ignore

    This file contains any words that are correct in the context of
    Emacs, or that we otherwise choose to ignore.  Use your best
    judgment when adding words to this file.  Common typos that are
    only correct in highly specific contexts should probably be in
    codespell.exclude instead.

codespell.rc

    This file contains the Emacs specific codespell configuration.
