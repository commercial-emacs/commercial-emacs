In the interest of producing `make` targets, append TARGET-EXTENSION to
return values.  A TARGET-EXTENSION of nil intends returning the full
complement of loaded files, whether compiled or not.

For both 'elc' and 'eln' TARGET-EXTENSION, omit files excluded by the
no-byte-compile file-local directive.  For the latter, append the 'elc'
extension in lieu of 'eln' to files containing the no-native-compile
directive."
