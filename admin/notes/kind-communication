The GNU Project encourages contributions from anyone who wishes to
advance the development of the GNU system, regardless of gender, race,
ethnic group, physical appearance, religion, cultural background, and
any other demographic characteristics, as well as personal political
views.

People are sometimes discouraged from participating in GNU development
because of certain patterns of communication that strike them as
unfriendly, unwelcoming, rejecting, or harsh.  This discouragement
particularly affects members of disprivileged demographics, but it is
not limited to them.  Therefore, we ask all contributors to make a
conscious effort, in GNU Project discussions, to communicate in ways
that avoid that outcome â€” to avoid practices that will predictably and
unnecessarily risk putting some contributors off.

The GNU Kind Communications Guidelines suggest specific ways to
accomplish that goal.  You can find the latest version at
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html

When sending messages to Emacs mailing lists, we ask you to read and
respect these guidelines.
