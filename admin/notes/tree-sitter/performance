TREE-SITTER PERFORMANCE NOTES -*- org -*-

* Facts

Incremental parsing of a few characters worth of edit usually takes
less than 0.1ms. If it takes longer than that, something is wrong.
There’s one time where I found tree-sitter-c takes ~30ms to
incremental parse. Updating to the latest version of tree-sitter-c
solves it, so I didn’t investigate further.

The ranges set for a parser doesn’t grow when you insert text into a
range, so you have to update the ranges every time before
parsing. Fortunately, changing ranges doesn’t invalidate incremental
parsing, so there isn’t any performance lost in update ranges
frequently.
