(defvar-local font-lock-defaults nil
  "Defaults for Font Lock mode specified by the major mode.
Defaults should be of the form:

 (KEYWORDS [KEYWORDS-ONLY [CASE-FOLD [SYNTAX-ALIST ...]]])

KEYWORDS may be a symbol (a variable or function whose value is the keywords
to use for fontification) or a list of symbols (specifying different levels
of fontification).

If KEYWORDS-ONLY is non-nil, syntactic fontification (strings and
comments) is not performed.

If CASE-FOLD is non-nil, the case of the keywords is ignored when fontifying.

If SYNTAX-ALIST is non-nil, it should be a list of cons pairs of the form
\(CHAR-OR-STRING . STRING) used to set the local Font Lock syntax table, for
keyword and syntactic fontification (see `modify-syntax-entry').

These item elements are used by Font Lock mode to set the variables
`font-lock-keywords', `font-lock-keywords-only',
`font-lock-keywords-case-fold-search', `font-lock-syntax-table'.

Further item elements are alists of the form (VARIABLE . VALUE) and are in no
particular order.  Each VARIABLE is made buffer-local before set to VALUE.

Currently, appropriate variables include `font-lock-mark-block-function'.
If this is non-nil, it should be a function with no args used to mark any
enclosing block of text, for fontification via \\[font-lock-fontify-block].
Typical values are `mark-defun' for programming modes or `mark-paragraph' for
textual modes (i.e., the mode-dependent function is known to put point and mark
around a text block relevant to that mode).

Other variables include that for syntactic keyword fontification,
`font-lock-syntactic-keywords' and those for buffer-specialized fontification
functions, `font-lock-fontify-buffer-function',
`font-lock-unfontify-buffer-function', `font-lock-fontify-region-function',
`font-lock-unfontify-region-function'.")

It will be passed one argument, which is the current value of
`font-lock-mode'.")

(define-minor-mode font-lock-mode
  "Toggle syntax highlighting in this buffer (Font Lock mode).

When Font Lock mode is enabled, text is fontified as you type it:

 - Comments are displayed in `font-lock-comment-face';
 - Strings are displayed in `font-lock-string-face';
 - Certain other expressions are displayed in other faces
   according to the value of the variable `font-lock-keywords'.

To customize the faces (colors, fonts, etc.) used by Font Lock for
fontifying different parts of buffer text, use \\[customize-face].

Global Font Lock mode is active by default, and turns on Font
Lock mode for major modes amongst `font-lock-global-modes'.

While not recommended, Font Lock mode can be individually applied
by turning off Global Font Lock mode and adding `font-lock-mode'
to the major mode's hook, e.g.,

 (add-hook \\='c-mode-hook #\\='font-lock-mode)

For those major modes which support it, the variable
`font-lock-maximum-decoration' allows greater control over the
degree of highlighting.

Highlighting can be further customized with
`font-lock-add-keywords' and `font-lock-defaults'.

Expert users can specify their own `font-lock-function' to
supplant all of the above."
