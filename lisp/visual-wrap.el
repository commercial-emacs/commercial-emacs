;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the `visual-wrap-prefix-mode' minor mode
;; which sets the wrap-prefix property on the fly so that
;; single-long-line paragraphs get word-wrapped in a way similar to
;; what you'd get with M-q using adaptive-fill-mode, but without
;; actually changing the buffer's text.

;;; Code:

(defcustom visual-wrap-extra-indent 0
  "Number of extra spaces to indent in `visual-wrap-prefix-mode'.

`visual-wrap-prefix-mode' indents the visual lines to the level
of the actual line plus `visual-wrap-extra-indent'.  A negative
value will do a relative de-indent.

Examples:

actual indent = 2
extra indent = -1
