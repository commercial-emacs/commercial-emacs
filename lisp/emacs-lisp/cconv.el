;;; Commentary:

;; The user entry point is `cconv-closure-convert'.  All macros should
;; be expanded beforehand.
;;
;; First `cconv-analyze-form' identifies mutated variables (updated
;; by setq), variables captured by closure, and functions amenable to
;; lambda lifting.

;; Then `cconv-convert' rewrites the parse tree as follows:
;;
;; 1. Lifts lambdas where possible,
;; (lambda (v0) fv0 fv1) => ; fv are free variables
;;   (lambda (v0 fv0 fv1) fv0 fv1)
;;
;; 2. Builds closures where needed,
;; (lambda (v0) fv0 fv1) => ; fv are free variables
;;   (internal-make-closure (v0) (fv0) <doc>
;;    (internal-get-closed-var 0) (internal-get-closed-var 1))
;;
;; 3. Eliminates mutable variable that is also captured by closure.
;;            val => (list val)
;;            var => (car-safe var)
;; (setq var val) => (setcar var val)
;;
;; 4. Similarly wraps closure-mutable formal args in defuns.
;; (defun foo (mut) ...) =>
;; (defun foo (mut) (let ((mut (list mut))) ...))
;;
;;; Code:

;; TODO: (not just for cconv but lexbind generally)
;; - In edebug, find lexical bindings from the stack.
;; - Make eval-region do the eval-sexp-add-defvars dance.
;; - Apply byte-optimize-form before cconv (shift the "unused
;;   variable" warnings from cconv-analyze earlier to account for
;;   optimized away variables.
;; - Compiler hint for macros tying let-bindings to the same source,
;;   so that unused variable warnings take all uses into account.
;; - Interactive specs which return a function to construct the args.
;; - Standardize macro-expand so we don't have to handle (let (var) body)
;;   and other oddities.
;; - New byte codes for unwind-protect so that closures aren't needed at all.
;; - Static knowledge of a variable's unchangingness could be passed
;;   to byte-compiler, e.g. by using a new `immutable-let'.
;; - Call known non-escaping functions with `goto' rather than `call'.
