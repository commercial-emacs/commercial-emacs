;;; Commentary:

;; Interpretation of OSC (Operating System Commands) escape
;; sequences. Handlers for OSC 2, 7 and 8 (for window title, current
;; directory and hyperlinks respectively) are provided.

;; The function `osc-compilation-filter' can be added to
;; `compilation-filter-hook' to collect OSC sequences in compilation
;; buffers. The variable `osc-for-compilation-buffer' tells what to do
;; with collected sequences.

;;; Code:

(defconst osc-control-seq-regexp
  ;; See ECMA 48, section 8.3.89 "OSC - OPERATING SYSTEM COMMAND".
  "\e\\][\x08-\x0D]*[\x20-\x7E]*\\(\a\\|\e\\\\\\)"
  "Regexp matching an OSC control sequence.")

(defun osc-filter-region (begin end)
  "Filter out all OSC control sequences from region between BEGIN and END."
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char begin)
    ;; Delete escape sequences.

  "Alist of handlers for OSC escape sequences.
See `osc-apply-on-region' for details.")

(defvar-local osc--marker nil)
;; The function `osc-apply-on-region' can set `osc--marker' to the start
;; position of an escape sequence without termination.

(defun osc-apply-on-region (begin end)
  "Interpret OSC escape sequences in region between BEGIN and END.

    ESC ] command ; text BEL
    ESC ] command ; text ESC \\

Every occurrence of such escape sequences is removed from the
buffer.  Then, if `command' is a key in the alist that is the value
of the local variable `osc-handlers', that key's value, which should
be a function, is called with `command' and `text' as arguments, with
point where the escape sequence was located."
