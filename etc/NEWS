* Installation Changes in Emacs 29.1


* Startup Changes in Emacs 29.1

+++
** Emacs now has a --fingerprint option.
This will output a string identifying the current Emacs build.

+++
** New hook 'after-pdump-load-hook'.
This is run at the end of the Emacs startup process, and it meant to
be used to reinitialize structures that would normally be done at load
time.


* Changes in Emacs 29.1

** Help

---
*** Jumping to function/variable source now saves mark before moving point.
Jumping to source from "*Help*" buffer moves the point when the source
buffer is already open.  Now, the old point is pushed to mark ring.


* Editing Changes in Emacs 29.1

---
** Indentation of 'cl-flet' and 'cl-labels' has changed.
These forms now indent like this:

    (cl-flet ((bla (x)
		(* x x)))
      (bla 42))

This change also affects 'cl-macrolet', 'cl-flet*' and
'cl-symbol-macrolet'.

+++
** New user option 'translate-upper-case-key-bindings'.
This can be set to nil to inhibit translating upper case keys to lower
case keys.

+++
** New command 'ensure-empty-lines'.
This command increases (or decreases) the number of empty lines before
point.

---
*** Improved mouse behavior with auto-scrolling modes.
When clicking inside the `scroll-margin' or `hscroll-margin' region
the point is now moved only when releasing the mouse button.  This no
longer results in a bogus selection, unless the mouse has been
effectively dragged.


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 29.1

** image-dired

---
*** New command for the thumbnail buffer.
The new command 'image-dired-unmark-all-marks' has been added with a
binding in the menu.

---
*** info-look specs can now be expanded at run time instead of a load time.
The new ':doc-spec-function' element can be used to compute the
':doc-spec' element when the user asks for info on that particular
mode (instead of at load time).

** subr-x

+++
*** New macro 'with-memoization' provides a very primitive form of memoization

** ansi-color.el

---
*** Support for ANSI 256-color and 24-bit colors.
256-color and 24-bit color codes are now handled by ANSI color
filters and displayed with the specified color.

** term-mode

---
*** Support for ANSI 256-color and 24-bit colors, italic and other fonts.
Term-mode can now display 256-color and 24-bit color codes.  It can
also handle ANSI codes for faint, italic and blinking text, displaying
it with new 'ansi-term-faint/italic/slow-blinking/fast-blinking'
faces.


* New Modes and Packages in Emacs 29.1

+++
** New mode 'erts-mode'.
This mode is used to edit files geared towards testing actions in
Emacs buffers, like indentation and the like.  The new ert function
'ert-test-erts-file' is used to parse these files.


* Incompatible Lisp Changes in Emacs 29.1

---
** The 'inhibit-changing-match-data' variable is now obsolete.
Instead, functions like 'string-match' and 'looking-at' now take an
optional 'inhibit-modify' argument.

---
** 'gnus-define-keys' is now obsolete.
Use 'define-keymap' instead.

---
** MozRepl has been removed from js.el.
MozRepl was removed from Firefox in 2017, so this code doesn't work
with recent versions of Firefox.


* Lisp Changes in Emacs 29.1

+++
** :keys in 'menu-item' can now be a function.
If so, it is called whenever the menu is computed, and can be used to
calculate the keys dynamically.

+++
** New major mode 'clean-mode'.
This is a new major mode meant for debugging.  It kills absolutely all
local variables and removes overlays and text properties.

+++
** 'kill-all-local-variables' can now kill all local variables.
If given the new optional KILL-PERMANENT argument, also kill permanent
local variables.

+++
** Third 'mapconcat' argument 'separator' is now optional.
An explicit nil always meant the empty string, now it can be left out.

---
** Themes can now be made obsolete.
Using 'make-obsolete' on a theme is now supported.  This will make
'load-theme' issue a warning when loading the theme.

+++
** New function 'define-keymap'.
This function allows defining a number of keystrokes with one form.

+++
** New macro 'defvar-keymap'.
This macro allows defining keymap variables more conveniently.
