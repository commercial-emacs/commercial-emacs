Please send Emacs bug reports to 'bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org'.
If possible, use 'M-x report-emacs-bug'.

This file is about changes in Emacs version 31.

See file HISTORY for a list of GNU Emacs versions and release dates.
See files NEWS.30, NEWS.29, ..., NEWS.18, and NEWS.1-17 for changes
in older Emacs versions.

You can narrow news to a specific version by calling 'view-emacs-news'
with a prefix argument or by typing 'C-u C-h C-n'.

Temporary note:
+++ indicates that all relevant manuals in doc/ have been updated.
--- means no change in the manuals is needed.
When you add a new item, use the appropriate mark if you are sure it
applies, and please also update docstrings as needed.


* Installation Changes in Emacs 31.1

** When using GCC 4 or later to build Emacs on 32-bit x86 systems,
'configure' now defaults to using the GCC options -mfpmath=sse (if the
host system supports SSE2) or -fno-tree-sra (if not).  These GCC options
work around GCC bug 58416, which can cause Emacs to behave incorrectly
in rare cases.


* Startup Changes in Emacs 31.1


* Incompatible Changes in Emacs 30.1

** Mouse wheel events should now always be 'wheel-up/down/left/right'.
At those places where the old 'mouse-4/5/6/7' events could still occur
(i.e., X11 input in the absence of XInput2, and 'xterm-mouse-mode'),
we remap them to the corresponding 'wheel-up/down/left/right' event,
according to the new variable 'mouse-wheel-buttons'.
The old variables 'mouse-wheel-up-event', 'mouse-wheel-down-event',
'mouse-wheel-left-event', and 'mouse-wheel-right-event' are thereby
obsolete.

** Tree-Sitter modes are now declared as submodes of the non-TS modes.
In order to help the use of those Tree-Sitter modes, they are now
declared to have the corresponding non-Tree-Sitter mode as an
additional parent.
This way, things like ".dir-locals.el" settings, and YASnippet
collections of snippets automatically apply to the new Tree-Sitter modes.

Note that those modes still do not inherit from the non-TS mode, so
configuration settings installed via mode hooks are not affected.

+++
** URL now never sends user email addresses in HTTP requests.
Emacs never sent email addresses by default, but it used to be
possible to customize 'url-privacy-level' so that the users email
address was sent along in HTTP requests.  This feature has now been
removed, as it was considered more dangerous than useful.  RFC 9110
(§ 10.1.2) also recommends against it.  The user option
'url-personal-mail-address' is now also obsolete.

To send an email address in the header of individual HTTP requests,
see the variable 'url-request-extra-headers'.

+++
** 'completion-auto-help' now affects 'icomplete-in-buffer'.
Previously, 'completion-auto-help' mostly affected only minibuffer
completion.  Now, if 'completion-auto-help' has the value 'lazy', then
Icomplete's in-buffer display of possible completions will only appear
after the 'completion-at-point' command has been invoked twice, and if
'completion-auto-help' is nil, then Icomplete's in-buffer display is
completely suppressed.  Thus, if you use 'icomplete-in-buffer', ensure
'completion-auto-help' is not customized to 'lazy' or nil.

+++
** The "*Completions*" buffer now always accompanies 'icomplete-in-buffer'.
Previously, it was not consistent whether the "*Completions*" buffer would
appear when using 'icomplete-in-buffer'.  Now the "*Completions*" buffer
and Icomplete's in-buffer display of possible completions always
appear together.  If you would prefer to see only Icomplete's
in-buffer display, and not the "*Completions*" buffer, you can add this
to your init:

    (advice-add 'completion-at-point :after #'minibuffer-hide-completions)

** The default process filter was rewritten in native code.
The round-trip through the Lisp function
'internal-default-process-filter' is skipped when the process filter is
the default one.  It's reimplemented in native code, reducing GC churn.
To undo this change, set 'fast-read-process-output' to nil.


* Changes in Emacs 30.1

** 'describe-function' now shows the type of the function object.
The text used to say things like "car is is a built-in function" whereas
it now says "car is a primitive-function" where "primitive-function" is
the symbol returned by 'cl-type-of'.  You can click on those words to
get information about that type.

** 'advice-remove' is now an interactive command.
When called interactively, 'advice-remove' now prompts for an advised
function to the advice to remove.

** Emacs now supports Unicode Standard version 15.1.

** New pre-defined values for 'electric-quote-chars'.
The available customization options for 'electric-quote-chars' have been
updated with common pairs of quotation characters, including "‘", "’",
"“", "”", "«", "»", "‹", "›", "‚", "„", "「", "」", "『", and "』".
The default is unchanged.

** Network Security Manager

+++
*** The Network Security Manager now warns about 3DES by default.
This cypher is no longer recommended owing to a major vulnerability
disclosed in 2016, and its small 112 bit key size.  Emacs now warns
about its use also when 'network-security-level' is set to 'medium'
(the default).  See 'network-security-protocol-checks'.

---
*** The Network Security Manager now warns about <2048 bits in DH key exchange.
Emacs used to warn for Diffie-Hellman key exchanges with prime numbers
smaller than 1024 bits.  Since more servers now support it, this
number has been bumped to 2048 bits.

** Help

+++
*** New command 'help-find-source'.
Switch to a buffer visiting the source of what is being described in
"*Help*".  It is bound to 'C-h 4 s' globally.

*** 'describe-function' shows function inferred type when available.
For native compiled Lisp functions 'describe-function' prints (after
the signature) the automatically inferred function type as well.

---
*** New user option 'describe-bindings-outline-rules'.
This user option controls outline visibility in the output buffer of
'describe-bindings' when 'describe-bindings-outline' is non-nil.

---
*** 'C-h m' ('describe-mode') uses outlining by default.
Set 'describe-mode-outline' to nil to get back the old behavior.

*** 'C-h k' ('describe-key') shows Unicode name.
For keybindings which produce single characters via translation or input
methods, 'C-h k' now shows the Unicode name of the produced character in
addition to the character itself, e.g.

'C-h k C-x 8 E' =>

    € 'EURO SIGN' (translated from C-x 8 E)

*** 'C-h b' ('describe-bindings') shows Unicode names.
For keybindings which produce single characters via translation (such as
those using the 'C-x 8' or 'A-' prefix, or 'dead-acute', 'dead-grave',
etc), the Unicode names will now be shown in addition to the character
itself, i.e.

    A-!			¡	INVERTED EXCLAMATION MARK
    A-$			¤	CURRENCY SIGN

and so on.

** Emacs now comes with Org v9.7.
See the file "etc/ORG-NEWS" for user-visible changes in Org.

** Outline mode

*** New commands to show/hide outlines by regexp.
'/ h' ('outline-hide-by-heading-regexp') asks for a regexp and then
hides the body lines of all outlines whose heading lines match the
regexp.  '/ s' ('outline-show-by-heading-regexp') does the same but
shows the matched outlines.

+++
*** 'outline-minor-mode' is supported in tree-sitter major modes.
It can be used in all tree-sitter major modes that set either the
variable 'treesit-simple-imenu-settings' or 'treesit-outline-predicate'.

** X selection requests are now handled much faster and asynchronously.
This means it should be less necessary to disable the likes of
'select-active-regions' when Emacs is running over a slow network
connection.

** Emacs now updates invisible frames that are made visible by a compositor.
If an invisible or an iconified frame is shown to the user by the
compositing manager, Emacs will now redisplay such a frame even though
'frame-visible-p' returns nil or 'icon' for it.  This can happen, for
example, as part of preview for iconified frames.

---
** New user option 'menu-bar-close-window'.
When non-nil, selecting "Close" from the "File" menu or clicking
"Close" in the tool bar will result in the current window being
closed, if possible.

+++
** 'write-region-inhibit-fsync' now defaults to t in interactive mode,
as it has in batch mode since Emacs 24.

+++
** New user option 'remote-file-name-inhibit-delete-by-moving-to-trash'.
When non-nil, this option suppresses moving remote files to the local
trash when deleting.  Default is nil.

---
** New user option 'remote-file-name-inhibit-auto-save'.
If this user option is non-nil, 'auto-save-mode' will not auto-save
remote buffers.  The default is nil.

+++
** New user option 'remote-file-name-access-timeout'.
When a positive number, this option limits the call of 'access-file'
for remote files to this number of seconds.  Default is nil.

+++
** New user option 'yes-or-no-prompt'.
This allows the user to customize the prompt that is appended by
'yes-or-no-p' when asking questions.  The default value is
"(yes or no) ".

---
** New face 'display-time-date-and-time'.
This is used for displaying the time and date components of
'display-time-mode'.

---
** New icon images for general use.
Several symbolic icons are added to "etc/images/symbols", including
plus, minus, check-mark, star, etc.

+++
** Tool bars can now be placed on the bottom on more systems.
The 'tool-bar-position' frame parameter can be set to 'bottom' on all
window systems other than Nextstep.

+++
** New global minor mode 'modifier-bar-mode'.
When this minor mode is enabled, buttons representing modifier keys
are displayed along the tool bar.

+++
** New user option 'tool-bar-always-show-default'.
When non-nil, the tool bar at the top of a frame does not show buffer
local customization of the tool bar.  The default value is nil.

+++
** "d" in the mode line now indicates that the window is dedicated.
Windows have always been able to be dedicated to a specific buffer;
see 'window-dedicated-p'.  Now the mode line indicates the dedicated
status of a window, with "d" appearing in the mode line if a window is
dedicated and "D" if the window is strongly dedicated.  This indicator
appears before the buffer name, and after the buffer modification and
remote buffer indicators (usually "---" together).

+++
** New command 'toggle-window-dedicated'.
This makes it easy to interactively mark a specific window as
dedicated, so it won't be reused by 'display-buffer'.  This can be
useful for complicated window setups.  It is bound to 'C-x w d'
globally.

---
** New user option 'uniquify-dirname-transform'.
This can be used to customize how buffer names are uniquified, by
making arbitrary transforms on the buffer's directory name (whose
components are used to uniquify buffer names when they clash).  You
can use this to distinguish between buffers visiting files with the
same base name that belong to different projects by using the provided
transform function 'project-uniquify-dirname-transform'.

** 'insert-directory-program' is now a user option.
On *BSD and macOS systems, this user option now defaults to the "gls"
executable, if it exists.  This should remove the need to change its
value when installing GNU coreutils using something like ports or
Homebrew.

+++
** CL Print

+++
*** You can expand the "..." truncation everywhere.
The code that allowed "..." to be expanded in the "*Backtrace*" buffer
should now work anywhere the data is generated by 'cl-print'.

+++
*** The 'backtrace-ellipsis' button is replaced by 'cl-print-ellipsis'.

+++
*** hash-tables' contents can be expanded via the ellipsis.

+++
*** Modes can control the expansion via 'cl-print-expand-ellipsis-function'.

+++
*** New setting 'raw' for 'cl-print-compiled'.
This setting causes byte-compiled functions to be printed in full by
'prin1'.  A button on this output can be activated to disassemble the
function.

+++
*** There is a new chapter in the CL manual documenting cl-print.el.
See the Info node "(cl) Printing".

** Modeline elements can now be right-aligned.
Anything following the symbol 'mode-line-format-right-align' in
'mode-line-format' will be right-aligned.  Exactly where it is
right-aligned to is controlled by the new user option
'mode-line-right-align-edge'.

** Windows

+++
*** New action alist entry 'some-window' for 'display-buffer'.
It specifies which window 'display-buffer-use-some-window' should prefer.
For example, when 'display-buffer-base-action' is customized to
'(nil . ((some-window . mru)))', then a buffer will be displayed
in the same most recently used window from consecutive calls of
'display-buffer' (in a configuration with more than two windows).

+++
*** New action alist entry 'category' for 'display-buffer'.
If the caller of 'display-buffer' passes '(category . symbol)'
in its 'action' argument, you can match the displayed buffer
by adding '(category . symbol)' to the condition part of
'display-buffer-alist' entries.

+++
*** New action alist entry 'post-command-select-window' for 'display-buffer'.
It specifies whether the window of the displayed buffer should be
selected or deselected at the end of executing the current command.

---
*** User option 'display-comint-buffer-action' is now obsolete.
You can use a '(category . comint)' condition in 'display-buffer-alist'
to match buffers displayed by comint-related commands.  Another
user option 'display-tex-shell-buffer-action' is obsolete too
for which you can use '(category . tex-shell)'.

+++
*** New variable 'window-restore-killed-buffer-windows'.
It specifies how 'set-window-configuration' and 'window-state-put'
should proceed with windows whose buffer was killed after the
corresponding configuration or state was recorded.

*** New variable 'window-point-context-set-function'.
It can be used to set a context for window point in all windows by
'window-point-context-set' before calling 'current-window-configuration'
and 'window-state-get'.  Then later another new variable
'window-point-context-use-function' can be used by
'window-point-context-use' after 'set-window-configuration' and
'window-state-put' to restore positions of window points
according to the context stored in a window parameter.

+++
*** New functions 'set-window-cursor-type' and 'window-cursor-type'.
'set-window-cursor-type' sets a per-window cursor type, and
'window-cursor-type' queries this setting for a given window.  Windows
are always created with a 'window-cursor-type' of t, which means to
consult the variable 'cursor-type' as before.

** Tab Bars and Tab Lines

---
*** New user option 'tab-bar-select-restore-context'.
It uses 'window-point-context-set' to save contexts where
window points were located before switching away from the tab,
and 'window-point-context-use' to restore positions of window
points after switching back to that tab.

---
*** New user option 'tab-bar-select-restore-windows'.
It defines what to do with windows whose buffer was killed since the tab
was last selected.  By default it displays a placeholder buffer
with the name " *Old buffer <name>*" that provides information about
the name of the killed buffer that was displayed in that window.

---
*** New user option 'tab-bar-tab-name-format-functions'.
It can be used to add, remove and reorder functions that change the
appearance of every tab on the tab bar.

---
*** New hook 'tab-bar-tab-post-select-functions'.

---
*** New keymap 'tab-bar-mode-map'.
By default it contains a keybinding 'C-TAB' to switch tabs, but only
when 'C-TAB' is not bound globally.  You can unbind it if it conflicts
with 'C-TAB' in other modes.

---
*** New keymap 'tab-line-mode-map'.
By default it contains keybindings for switching tabs: 'C-x <left>',
'C-x <right>', 'C-x C-<left>', 'C-x C-<right>'.  You can unbind them if
you want to use these keys for the commands 'previous-buffer' and
'next-buffer'.

---
*** Default list of tabs is changed to support a fixed order.
This means that 'tab-line-tabs-fixed-window-buffers', the new default
tabs function, is like the previous 'tab-line-tabs-window-buffers' where
both of them show only buffers that were previously displayed in the
window.  But the difference is that the new function always keeps the
original order of buffers on the tab line, even after switching between
these buffers.  You can drag the tabs and release at a new position
to manually reorder the buffers on the tab line.

---
*** New user option 'tab-line-tabs-buffer-group-function'.
It provides two choices to group tab buffers by major mode and by
project name.

---
*** Buffers on group tabs are now sorted alphabetically.
This will keep the fixed order of tabs, even after switching between
them.

+++
** New optional argument for modifying directory-local variables.
The commands 'add-dir-local-variable', 'delete-dir-local-variable' and
'copy-file-locals-to-dir-locals' now take an optional prefix argument,
to enter the file name you want to modify.

** Emacs Server and Client

---
*** 'server-eval-args-left' can be used to pop and eval subsequent args.
When '--eval' is passed to emacsclient and Emacs is evaluating each
argument, this variable is set to those arguments not yet evaluated.
It can be used to 'pop' arguments and process them by the function
called in the '--eval' expression, which is useful when those
arguments contain arbitrary characters that otherwise might require
elaborate and error-prone escaping (to protect them from the shell).

+++
** 'recover-file' can show diffs between auto save file and current file.
When answering the prompt with "diff" or "=", it now shows the diffs
between the auto save file and the current file.

---
** 'ffap-lax-url' now defaults to nil.
Previously, it was set to t but this broke remote file name detection.

+++
** Multi-character key echo now ends with a suggestion to use Help.
Customize 'echo-keystrokes-help' to nil to prevent that.

+++
** 'read-passwd' can toggle the visibility of passwords.
Use 'TAB' in the minibuffer to show or hide the password.  Likewise,
there is an icon on the mode-line, which toggles the visibility of the
password when clicking with 'mouse-1'.

+++
** Support for styled underline face attributes.
These are implemented as new values of the 'style' attribute in a face
underline specification, 'double-line', 'dots', and 'dashes', and are
available on GUI systems.  If your terminal's termcap or terminfo
database entry defines the 'Su' or 'Smulx' capability, Emacs will also
emit the prescribed escape sequence to render faces with such styles on
TTY frames.

---
** Support for underline colors on TTY frames.
Colors specified in face underlines will now also be displayed in TTY
frames with the previously mentioned capabilities.

** Miscellaneous

---
*** New face 'appt-notification' for 'appt-display-mode-line'.
It can be used to customize the look of the appointment notification
displayed on the mode line when 'appt-display-mode-line' is non-nil.

---
*** Emacs now recognizes shebang lines that pass '-S'/'--split-string' to 'env'.
When visiting a script that invokes 'env -S INTERPRETER ARGS...' in
its shebang line, Emacs will now skip over 'env -S' and deduce the
major mode based on the interpreter after 'env -S'.

+++
** New function 'sqlite-execute-batch'.
This function lets the user execute multiple SQL statements in one go.
It is useful, for example, when a Lisp program needs to evaluate an
entire SQL file.

** The default value of 'read-process-output-max' was increased to 65536.

* Editing Changes in Emacs 30.1

+++
** New minor mode 'visual-wrap-prefix-mode'.
When enabled, continuation lines displayed for a wrapped long line
will receive a 'wrap-prefix' automatically computed from the line's
surrounding context, such that continuation lines are indented on
display as if they were filled with 'M-q' or similar.  Unlike 'M-q',
the indentation only happens on display, and doesn't change the buffer
text in any way.  The global minor mode
'global-visual-wrap-prefix-mode' enables this minor mode in all
buffers.

(This minor mode is the 'adaptive-wrap' ELPA package renamed and
lightly edited for inclusion in Emacs.)

+++
** New user option 'gud-highlight-current-line'.
When enabled, Gud will visually emphasize the line being executed upon
pauses in the debugee's execution, such as those occasioned by
breakpoints being hit.

---
** New global minor mode 'kill-ring-deindent-mode'.
When enabled, text being saved to the kill ring will be de-indented by
the column number at its start.  For example, saving the entire
function call within:

foo ()
{
  long_function_with_several_arguments (argument_1_compute (),
					argument_2_compute (),
					argument_3_compute ());
}

will save:

long_function_with_several_arguments (argument_1_compute (),
				      argument_2_compute (),
				      argument_3_compute ())

to the kill ring, omitting the two columns of extra indentation that
would otherwise be present in the second and third lines of the
function call.

+++
** Emacs now has better support for touchscreen devices.
On systems that understand them (at present X, Android, PGTK, and
MS-Windows), many touch screen gestures are now implemented and
translated into mouse or gesture events, and support for tapping tool
bar buttons and opening menus has been written.  Countless packages,
such as Dired and Custom have been adjusted to better understand touch
screen input.

---
** On X, Emacs now supports input methods which perform "string conversion".
This means an input method can now ask Emacs to delete text
surrounding point and replace it with something else, as well as query
Emacs for surrounding text.  If your input method allows you to "undo"
mistaken compositions, this will now work as well.

---
** New command 'kill-matching-buffers-no-ask'.
This works like 'kill-matching-buffers', but without asking for
confirmation.

---
** New user option 'duplicate-region-final-position'.
It controls the placement of point and the region after duplicating a
region with 'duplicate-dwim'.

+++
** New user option 'mouse-prefer-closest-glyph'.
When enabled, clicking or dragging with the mouse will put the point
or start the drag in front of the buffer position corresponding to the
glyph with the closest X coordinate to the click or start of the drag.
In other words, if the mouse pointer is in the right half of a glyph,
point will be put after the buffer position corresponding to that glyph,
whereas if the mouse pointer is in the left half of a glyph, point
will be put in front the buffer position corresponding to that glyph.
By default this is disabled.

** Internationalization

---
*** Users in CJK locales can control width of some non-CJK characters.
Some characters are considered by Unicode as "ambiguous" with respect
to their display width: either "full-width" (i.e., taking 2 columns on
display) or "narrow" (taking 1 column).  The actual width depends on
the fonts used for these characters by Emacs or (for text-mode frames)
by the terminal emulator.  Traditionally, font sets in CJK locales
were set up so as to display these characters as full-width, and thus
Emacs modified the char-width table in those locales to follow suit.
Lately, the tendency is to display these characters as narrow.  The
new user option 'cjk-ambiguous-chars-are-wide' allows users to control
whether Emacs considers these characters as full-width (the default)
or narrow (if the variable is customized to the nil value).

This setting affects the results of 'string-width' and similar
functions in CJK locales.

---
*** New input methods for the Urdu, Pashto, and Sindhi languages.
These languages are spoken in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

---
*** New input method "english-colemak".
This input method supports the Colemak keyboard layout.

*** Additional 'C-x 8' key translations for "æ" and "Æ".
These characters can now be input with 'C-x 8 a e' and 'C-x 8 A E',
respectively, in addition to the existing translations 'C-x 8 / e' and
'C-x 8 / E'.

*** New 'C-x 8' key translations for "low" quotes "„", and "‚".
These can now be entered with 'C-x , "' and 'C-x , ''.

*** New German language 'C-x 8' key translations for quotation marks.
The characters "„", "“", and "”" can now be entered with 'C-x 8 v',
'C-x 8 b' and 'C-x 8 n'.  The single versions "‚", "‘", and "’" can now
be entered with 'C-x 8 V', 'C-x 8 B' and 'C-x 8 N'.  These characters
are used for the official German quoting style.  Using them requires
activating German language support via 'iso-transl-set-language'.

*** "latin-prefix" and "latin-postfix" quotation marks additions.
These input methods can now produce single, double and "low" left and
right quotation marks:

    "‘", "’", "“", "”", "„", and "‚"

by using "[", "]", and "," for "left", "right", and "low" respectively
to modify "'" and """.

*** "latin-prefix" and "latin-postfix" guillemets support.
These input methods can now produce single guillemets "‹" and "›".  For
"latin-prefix" use "~~<" and "~~>", for "latin-postfix" use "<~" and
">~".  Double guillemets ("«" and "»") were already supported.

*** New French language 'C-x 8' key translations for "‹" and "›".
These characters can now be entered using 'C-x 8 ~ <' and 'C-x 8 ~ >'
respectively, after activating French language support via
'iso-transl-set-language'.  Double guillemets were already supported via
'C-x 8 <' and 'C-x 8 >'

*** Additional 'C-x 8' key translation for Euro "€" currency symbol.
This can now be entered using 'C-x 8 E' in addition to the existing
'C-x 8 * E' translation.


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 30.1

---
** Titdic-cnv
Most of the variables and functions in the file have been renamed to
make sure they all use a 'tit-' namespace prefix.

---
** Trace
In batch mode, tracing now sends the trace to stdout.

+++
** Mwheel
The 'wheel-up/down/left/right' events are now bound unconditionally,
and the 'mouse-wheel-up/down/left/right-event' variables are thus used
only to specify the 'mouse-4/5/6/7' events that might still
happen to be generated by some old packages (or if 'mouse-wheel-buttons'
has been set to nil).

** Xterm Mouse mode
This mode now emits 'wheel-up/down/right/left' events instead of
'mouse-4/5/6/7' events for the mouse wheel.
It uses the new variable 'mouse-wheel-buttons' to decide which button
maps to which wheel event (if any).

** Info

---
*** New user option 'Info-url-alist'.
This user option associates manual names with URLs.  It affects the
'Info-goto-node-web' command.  By default, associations for all
Emacs-included manuals are set.  Further associations can be added for
arbitrary Info manuals.

*** Emacs can now display Info manuals compressed with 'lzip'.
This requires the 'lzip' program to be installed on your system.

+++
** New command 'lldb'.
Run the LLDB debugger, analogous to the 'gud-gdb' command.

** GDB MI

---
*** Variable order and truncation can now be configured in 'gdb-many-windows'.
The new user option 'gdb-locals-table-row-config' allows users to
configure the order and max length of various properties in the local
variables buffer when using 'gdb-many-windows'.

By default, this user option is set to write the properties in the order:
name, type and value, where the name and type are truncated to 20
characters, and the value is truncated according to the value of
'gdb-locals-value-limit'.

If you want to get back the old behavior, set the user option to the value

    (setopt gdb-locals-table-row-config
            `((type . 0) (name . 0) (value . ,gdb-locals-value-limit)))

---
*** New user option 'gdb-display-io-buffer'.
If this is nil, 'M-x gdb' will neither create nor display a separate
buffer for the I/O of the program being debugged, but will instead
redirect the program's interaction to the GDB execution buffer.  The
default is t, to preserve previous behavior.

** Grep

*** New user option 'grep-use-headings'.
When non-nil, the output of Grep is split into sections, one for each
file, instead of having file names prefixed to each line.  It is
equivalent to the "--heading" option of some tools such as 'git grep'
and 'rg'.  The headings are displayed using the new 'grep-heading'
face.

** Compilation mode

---
*** The 'omake' matching rule is now disabled by default.
This is because it partly acts by modifying other rules which may
occasionally be surprising.  It can be re-enabled by adding 'omake' to
'compilation-error-regexp-alist'.

*** Lua errors and stack traces are now recognized.
Compilation mode now recognizes Lua language errors and stack traces.
Every Lua error is recognized as a compilation error, and every Lua
stack frame is recognized as a compilation info.

** Project

+++
*** New user option 'project-mode-line'.
When non-nil, display the name of the current project on the mode
line.  Clicking 'mouse-1' on the project name pops up the project
menu.  The default value is nil.

*** New user option 'project-file-history-behavior'.
Customizing it to 'relativize' makes commands like 'project-find-file'
and 'project-find-dir' display previous history entries relative to
the current project.

*** New user option 'project-key-prompt-style'.
The look of the key prompt in the project switcher has been changed
slightly.  To get the previous one, set this option to 'brackets'.

*** 'project-try-vc' tries harder to find the responsible VCS.
When 'project-vc-extra-root-markers' is non-nil, and causes a
subdirectory project to be detected which is not a VCS root, we now
additionally traverse the parent directories until a VCS root is found
(if any), so that the ignore rules for that repository are used, and
the file listing's performance is still optimized.

*** New commands 'project-any-command' and 'project-prefix-or-any-command'.
The former is now bound to 'C-x p o' by default.
The latter is designed primarily for use as a value of
'project-switch-commands'.  If instead of a short menu you prefer to
have access to all keys defined inside 'project-prefix-map', as well
as global bindings (to run other commands inside the project root),
you can add this to your init script:

    (setopt project-switch-commands #'project-prefix-or-any-command)

---
*** New variable 'project-files-relative-names'.
If it's non-nil, 'project-files' can return file names relative to the
project root.  Project backends can use this to improve the performance
of their 'project-files' implementation.

** VC

---
*** Log-Edit buffers now display a tool bar.
This tool bar contains items for committing log entries and editing or
generating log entries, among other editing operations.

---
*** New user option 'vc-git-shortlog-switches'.
This is a string or a list of strings that specifies the Git log
switches for shortlogs, such as the one produced by 'C-x v L'.
'vc-git-log-switches' is no longer used for shortlogs.

---
*** New value 'no-backend' for user option 'vc-display-status'.
With this value only the revision number is displayed on the mode-line.

---
*** Obsolete command 'vc-switch-backend' re-added as 'vc-change-backend'.
The command was previously obsoleted and unbound in Emacs 28.

*** Support for viewing VC change history across renames.
When a fileset's VC change history ('C-x v l') ends at a rename, we
now print the old name(s) and a button which jumps to their history.
Git and Hg are supported.  Naturally, 'vc-git-print-log-follow' should
be nil for this to work (or '--follow' should not be in
'vc-hg-print-log-switches', in Hg's case).  Unlike when the '--follow'
switch is used, commands to see the diff of the old revision ('d'),
check out an old file version ('f') or annotate it right away ('a'),
also work on revisions which precede renames.

---
*** 'vc-annotate' now abbreviates the Git revision in the buffer name.
When using the Git backend, 'vc-annotate' will use an abbreviated
revision identifier in its buffer name.  To restore the previous
behavior, set 'vc-annotate-use-short-revision' to nil.

*** New option 'vc-git-file-name-changes-switches'.
It allows tweaking the thresholds for rename and copy detection.

** Diff mode

---
*** New user option 'diff-refine-nonmodified'.
When this is non-nil, 'diff-refine' will highlight lines that were added
or removed in their entirety (as opposed to modified lines, where some
parts of the line were modified), using the same faces as for
highlighting the words added and removed within modified lines.  The
default value is nil.

+++
*** 'diff-ignore-whitespace-hunk' can now be applied to all hunks.
When called with a non-nil prefix argument,
'diff-ignore-whitespace-hunk' now iterates over all the hunks in the
current diff, regenerating them without whitespace changes.

+++
*** New user option 'diff-ignore-whitespace-switches'.
This allows changing which type of whitespace changes are ignored when
regenerating hunks with 'diff-ignore-whitespace-hunk'.  Defaults to
the previously hard-coded "-b".

*** New command 'diff-apply-buffer' bound to 'C-c RET a'.
It applies the diff in the entire diff buffer and
saves all modified file buffers.

** Isearch and Replace

*** New command 'replace-regexp-as-diff'.
It reads a regexp to search for and a string to replace with, then
displays a buffer with replacements as diffs.  After reviewing the
changes in the output buffer you can apply the replacements as
a patch to the current file buffer.  There are also new commands
'multi-file-replace-regexp-as-diff' that shows as diffs replacements
in a list of specified files, and 'dired-do-replace-regexp-as-diff'
that shows as diffs replacements in the marked files in Dired.

** Dired

---
*** New user option 'dired-movement-style'.
When non-nil, make 'dired-next-line', 'dired-previous-line',
'dired-next-dirline', 'dired-prev-dirline' skip empty lines.
It also controls how to move point when encountering a boundary
(e.g., if every line is visible, invoking 'dired-next-line' at
the last line will move to the first line).  The default is nil.

*** New user option 'dired-filename-display-length'.
It is an integer representing the maximum display length of filenames.
The middle part of a filename whose length exceeds the restriction is
hidden and an ellipsis is displayed instead.  A value of 'window'
means using the right edge of window as the display restriction.  The
default is nil.

*** New user option 'shell-command-guess-functions'.
It defines how to populate a list of commands available
for 'M-!', 'M-&', '!', '&' and the context menu "Open With"
based on marked files in Dired.  Possible backends are
'dired-guess-default', MIME types, XDG configuration
and a universal command such as "open" or "start"
that delegates to the OS.

*** New command 'dired-do-open'.
This command is bound to 'E' (mnemonics "External").  Also it can be
used by clicking "Open" in the context menu; it "opens" the marked or
clicked on files according to the OS conventions.  For example, on
systems supporting XDG, this runs 'xdg-open' on the files.

*** New variable 'dired-guess-shell-alist-optional'.
It contains commands for external viewers and players for various media
formats, moved to this list from 'dired-guess-shell-alist-default'.

*** The default value of 'dired-omit-size-limit' was increased.
After performance improvements to omitting in large directories, the new
default value is 300k, up from 100k.  This means 'dired-omit-mode' will
omit files in directories whose directory listing is up to 300 kilobytes
in size.

+++
*** 'dired-listing-switches' handles connection-local values if exist.
This allows to customize different switches for different remote machines.

** Registers

+++
*** New mode of prompting for register names and showing preview.
The new user option 'register-use-preview' can be customized to the
value t or insist to request a different user interface of prompting for
register names and previewing the registers: Emacs will require
confirmation for overwriting the value of a register, and will show
the preview of registers without delay.  You can also customize this
new option to disable the preview completely.

The default value of 'register-use-preview' preserves the behavior of
Emacs 29 and before.  See the Info node "(emacs) Registers" for more
details about the new UI and its variants.

** Ediff

---
*** New user option 'ediff-floating-control-frame'.
If non-nil, try making the control frame be floating rather than tiled.

Many X tiling window managers make the Ediff control frame a tiled
window equal in size to the main Emacs frame, which works poorly.
This option is useful to set if you use such a window manager.

** Buffer Selection

---
*** New user option 'bs-default-action-list'.
You can now configure how to display the "*buffer-selection*" buffer
using this new option.  (Or set 'display-buffer-alist' directly.)

** Eshell

+++
*** You can now run Eshell scripts in batch mode.
By adding the following interpreter directive to an Eshell script, you
can make it executable like other shell scripts:

    #!/usr/bin/env -S emacs --batch -f eshell-batch-file

+++
*** New builtin Eshell command 'compile'.
This command runs another command, sending its output to a compilation
buffer when the command would output interactively.  This can be useful
when defining aliases so that they produce a compilation buffer when
appropriate, but still allow piping the output elsewhere if desired.
For more information, see the "(eshell) Built-ins" node in the Eshell
manual.

+++
*** Eshell's 'env' command now supports running commands.
Like in many other shells, Eshell's 'env' command now lets you run a
command passed as arguments to 'env'.  If you pass any initial
arguments of the form 'VAR=VALUE', 'env' will first set 'VAR' to
'VALUE' before running the command.

---
*** Eshell's 'umask' command now supports setting the mask symbolically.
Now, you can pass an argument like "u+w,o-r" to Eshell's 'umask'
command, which will give write permission for owners of newly-created
files and deny read permission for users who are not members of the
file's group.  See the Info node "(coreutils) File permissions" for
more information on this notation.

---
*** Performance improvements for interactive output in Eshell.
Interactive output in Eshell should now be significantly faster,
especially for commands that can print large amounts of output
(e.g. "cat").  For external commands, Eshell saves time by only looking
for password prompts in the last 256 characters of each block of output.
To restore the previous behavior when checking for password prompts, set
'eshell-password-prompt-max-length' to 'most-positive-fixnum'.

---
*** Eshell built-in commands can now display progress.
Eshell built-in commands like "cat" and "ls" now update the display
periodically while running to show their progress.

+++
*** New special reference type '#<marker POSITION BUFFER>'.
This special reference type returns a marker at 'POSITION' in
'BUFFER'.  You can insert it by typing or using the new interactive
command 'eshell-insert-marker'.  You can also insert special
references of any type using the new interactive command
'eshell-insert-special-reference'.  See the "(eshell) Arguments" node
in the Eshell manual for more details.

+++
*** New splice operator for Eshell dollar expansions.
Dollar expansions in Eshell now let you splice the elements of the
expansion in-place using '$@expr'.  This makes it easier to fill lists
of arguments into a command, such as when defining aliases.  For more
information, see the "(eshell) Dollars Expansion" node in the Eshell
manual.

+++
*** You can now splice Eshell globs in-place into argument lists.
By setting 'eshell-glob-splice-results' to a non-nil value, Eshell
will expand glob results in-place as if you had typed each matching
file name individually.  For more information, see the "(eshell)
Globbing" node in the Eshell manual.

+++
*** Eshell now supports negative numbers and ranges for indices.
Now, you can retrieve the last element of a list with '$my-list[-1]'
or get a sublist of elements 2 through 4 with '$my-list[2..5]'.  For
more information, see the "(eshell) Dollars Expansion" node in the
Eshell manual.

+++
*** Eshell commands can now be explicitly-remote (or local).
By prefixing a command name in Eshell with a remote identifier, like
"/ssh:user@remote:whoami", you can now run commands on a particular
host no matter your current directory.  Likewise, you can run a
command on your local system no matter your current directory via
"/local:whoami".  For more information, see the "(eshell) Remote Access"
node in the Eshell manual.

+++
*** Eshell's '$UID' and '$GID' variables are now connection-aware.
Now, when expanding '$UID' or '$GID' in a remote directory, the value
is the user or group ID associated with the remote connection.

---
*** Eshell now uses 'field' properties in its output.
In particular, this means that pressing the '<home>' key moves the
point to the beginning of your input, not the beginning of the whole
line.  If you want to go back to the old behavior, add something like
this to your configuration:

    (keymap-set eshell-mode-map "<home>" #'eshell-bol-ignoring-prompt)

This also means you no longer need to adjust 'eshell-prompt-regexp'
when customizing your Eshell prompt.

---
*** You can now properly unload Eshell.
Calling '(unload-feature 'eshell)' no longer signals an error, and now
correctly unloads Eshell and all of its modules.

+++
*** 'eshell-read-aliases-list' is now an interactive command.
After manually editing 'eshell-aliases-file', you can use this command
to load the edited aliases.

+++
*** 'rgrep' is now a builtin command.
Running 'rgrep' in Eshell now uses the Emacs grep facility instead of
calling external rgrep.

+++
*** If a command exits abnormally, the Eshell prompt now shows its exit code.

+++
*** New user option 'eshell-history-append'.
If non-nil, each Eshell session will save history by appending new
entries of that session to the history file rather than overwriting
the file with the whole history of the session.  The default is nil.

** Minibuffer and Completions

*** New commands 'previous-line-completion' and 'next-line-completion'.
Bound to '<up>' and '<down>' arrow keys, respectively, they navigate
the "*Completions*" buffer vertically by lines, wrapping at the
top/bottom when 'completion-auto-wrap' is non-nil.

*** New user option 'minibuffer-visible-completions'.
When customized to non-nil, you can use arrow keys in the minibuffer
to navigate the completions displayed in the "*Completions*" window.
Typing 'RET' selects the highlighted candidate.  'C-g' hides the
completions window.  When the completions window is not visible,
then all these keys have their usual meaning in the minibuffer.
This option is supported for in-buffer completion as well.

*** Selected completion candidates are deselected on typing.
When you type at the minibuffer prompt, the current completion
candidate will be un-highlighted, and point in the "*Completions*" window
will be moved off that candidate.  'minibuffer-choose-completion'
('M-RET') will still choose a previously-selected completion
candidate, but the new command 'minibuffer-choose-completion-or-exit'
(bound to 'RET' by 'minibuffer-visible-completions') will exit with
the minibuffer contents instead.  This deselection behavior can be
controlled with the new user option 'completion-auto-deselect', which
is t by default.

*** New value 'historical' for user option 'completions-sort'.
When 'completions-sort' is set to 'historical', completion candidates
will be first sorted alphabetically, and then re-sorted by their order
in the minibuffer history, with more recent candidates appearing first.

+++
*** 'completion-category-overrides' supports more metadata.
The new supported completion properties are 'cycle-sort-function',
'display-sort-function', 'annotation-function', 'affixation-function',
and 'group-function'.  You can now customize them for any category in
'completion-category-overrides' that will override the properties
defined in completion metadata.

+++
*** 'completion-extra-properties' supports more metadata.
The new supported completion properties are 'category',
'group-function', 'display-sort-function', and 'cycle-sort-function'.

** Pcomplete

---
*** New user option 'pcomplete-remote-file-ignore'.
When this option is non-nil, remote file names are not completed by
Pcomplete.  Packages, like 'shell-mode', could set this in order to
suppress remote file name completion at all.

---
*** Completion for the 'doas' command has been added.
Command completion for 'doas' in Eshell and Shell mode will now work.

** Shell mode

+++
*** New user option 'shell-get-old-input-include-continuation-lines'.
When this user option is non-nil, 'shell-get-old-input' ('C-RET')
includes multiple shell "\" continuation lines from command output.
Default is nil.

+++
*** New user option 'shell-history-file-name'.
When this user option is set to t, 'shell-mode' does not read the shell
history file.  Setting this user option to a string specifies the name
of the shell history file to be read.  A nil value triggers reading the
environment variable 'HISTFILE'.

In a 'shell' buffer, this user option is connection-local.

---
*** Performance improvements for interactive output.
Interactive output in Shell mode now scans more selectively for password
prompts by only examining the last 256 characters of each block of
output, reducing the time spent when printing large amounts of output.
To restore the old behavior, set 'comint-password-prompt-max-length' to
'most-positive-fixnum'.

** Make mode

*** The Makefile browser is now obsolete.
The command 'makefile-switch-to-browser' command is now obsolete,
together with related commands used in the "*Macros and Targets*"
buffer.  We recommend using an alternative like 'imenu' instead.

** Prog mode

+++
*** New command 'prog-fill-reindent-defun'.
This command either fills a single paragraph in a defun, such as a
docstring, or a comment, or (re)indents the surrounding defun if
point is not in a comment or a string.  It is by default bound to
'M-q' in 'prog-mode' and all its descendants.

** Imenu

+++
*** New user option 'imenu-flatten'.
It controls  whether to flatten the list of sections in an imenu, and
how to display the sections in the flattened list.

+++
*** The sort order of Imenu completions can now be customized.
You can customize the option 'completion-category-overrides'
and set 'display-sort-function' for the category 'imenu'.

** Which Function mode

+++
*** Which Function mode can now display function names on the header line.
The new user option 'which-func-display' allows choosing where the
function name is displayed.  The default is 'mode' to display in the
mode line.  'header' will display in the header line;
'mode-and-header' displays in both the header line and mode line.

+++
*** New user option 'which-func-update-delay'.
This replaces the user option 'idle-update-delay', which was previously
used to control the delay before 'which-function-mode' updated its
display.  The user option 'idle-update-delay', which was only used by
Which Function mode, is now obsolete.

** Tramp

+++
*** Tramp methods can be optional.
An optional connection method is not enabled by default.  The user must
enable it explicitly by the 'tramp-enable-method' command.  The existing
methods "fcp", "krlogin", " ksu" and "nc" are optional now.

+++
*** New optional connection method "androidsu".
This provides access to system files with elevated privileges granted by
the idiosyncratic 'su' implementations and system utilities customary on
Android.

+++
*** New optional connection method "run0".
This connection method is similar to "sudo", but it uses the
'systemd-run' program internally.

+++
*** New connection methods "dockercp" and "podmancp".
These are the external methods counterparts of "docker" and "podman".

+++
*** New optional connection methods for containers.
There are new optional connection methods "toolbox", "distrobox",
"flatpak", "apptainer" and "nspawn".  They allow accessing system
containers provided by Toolbox or Distrobox, sandboxes provided by
Flatpak, instances managed by Apptainer, or accessing systemd-based
light-weight containers..

+++
*** Connection method "kubernetes" supports now optional container name.
The host name for Kubernetes connections can be of kind [CONTAINER.]POD,
in order to specify a dedicated container.  If there is just the pod
name, the first container in the pod is taken.  The new user options
'tramp-kubernetes-context' and 'tramp-kubernetes-namespace' allow
accessing pods with different context or namespace but the default one.

+++
*** Rename 'tramp-use-ssh-controlmaster-options' to 'tramp-use-connection-share'.
The old name still exists as obsolete variable alias.  This user
option controls now connection sharing for both ssh-based and
plink-based methods.  It allows the values t, nil, and 'suppress'.
The latter suppresses also "ControlMaster" settings in the user's
"~/.ssh/config" file, or connection share configuration in PuTTY
sessions, respectively.

+++
*** New command 'tramp-cleanup-some-buffers'.
It kills only a subset of opened remote buffers, subject to the user
option 'tramp-cleanup-some-buffers-hook'.

+++
*** New command 'inhibit-remote-files'.
This command disables the handling of file names with the special
remote file name syntax.  It should be applied only when remote files
won't be used in this Emacs instance.  It provides a slightly improved
performance of file name handling in Emacs.

+++
*** New macro 'without-remote-files'.
This macro could wrap code which handles local files only.  Due to the
temporary deactivation of remote files, it results in a slightly
improved performance of file name handling in Emacs.

+++
*** New user option 'tramp-completion-multi-hop-methods'.
It contains a list of connection methods for which completion should
be attempted at the end of a multi-hop chain.  This allows completion
candidates to include a list of, for example, containers running on a
remote docker host.

+++
*** New command 'tramp-revert-buffer-with-sudo'.
It reverts the current buffer to visit with "sudo" permissions.  The
buffer must either visit a file, or it must run 'dired-mode'.  Another
method but "sudo" can be configured with user option
'tramp-file-name-with-method'.

+++
*** Direct asynchronous processes are indicated by a connection-local variable.
If direct asynchronous processes shall be used, set the connection-local
variable 'tramp-direct-async-process' to a non-nil value.  This has been
changed, in previous Emacs versions this was indicated by the now
deprecated connection property "direct-async-process".  See the Tramp
manual "(tramp) Improving performance of asynchronous remote processes".

---
*** Direct asynchronous processes use 'tramp-remote-path'.
When a direct asynchronous process is invoked, it uses 'tramp-remote-path'
for setting the remote 'PATH' environment variable.

** File Notifications

+++
*** All backends except w32notify detect unmounting of a watched filesystem now.

** EWW

---
*** New mouse bindings in EWW buffers.
Certain form elements that were displayed as buttons, yet could only be
activated by keyboard input, are now operable using 'mouse-2'.  With
"Submit" buttons, this triggers submission of the form, while clicks on
other classes of buttons either toggle their values or prompt for user
input, as the case may be.

---
*** EWW text input fields and areas are now fields.
In consequence, movement commands and OS input method features now
recognize and confine their activities to the text input field around
point.  See also the Info node "(elisp) Fields".

+++
*** 'eww-open-file' can now display the file in a new buffer.
By default, the command reuses the "*eww*" buffer, but if called with
the new argument NEW-BUFFER non-nil, it will use a new buffer instead.
Interactively, invoke 'eww-open-file' with a prefix argument to
activate this behavior.

---
*** 'eww' URL or keyword prompt now has tab completion.
The interactive minibuffer prompt when invoking 'eww' now has support
for tab completion.

+++
*** 'eww' URL and keyword prompt now completes suggested URIs and bookmarks.
The interactive minibuffer prompt when invoking 'eww' now provides
completions from 'eww-suggest-uris'.  'eww-suggest-uris' now includes
bookmark URIs.

+++
*** New command 'eww-copy-alternate-url'.
It copies an alternate link on the page currently visited in EWW into
the kill ring.  Alternate links are optional metadata that HTML pages
use for linking to their alternative representations, such as
translated versions or associated RSS feeds.

+++
*** 'eww-open-in-new-buffer' supports the prefix argument.
When invoked with the prefix argument ('C-u'),
'eww-open-in-new-buffer' will not make the new buffer the current one.
This is useful for continuing reading the URL in the current buffer
when the new URL is fetched.

---
*** History navigation in EWW now behaves as in other browsers.
Previously, when navigating back and forward through page history, EWW
would add a duplicate entry to the end of the history list each time.
This made it impossible to navigate to the "end" of the history list.
Now, navigating through history in EWW simply changes your position in
the history list, allowing you to reach the end as expected.  In
addition, when browsing to a new page from a "historical" one (i.e., a
page loaded by navigating back through history), EWW deletes the history
entries newer than the current page.  To change the behavior when
browsing from "historical" pages, you can customize
'eww-before-browse-history-function'.

+++
*** 'eww-readable' now toggles display of the readable parts of a web page.
When called interactively, 'eww-readable' toggles whether to display
only the readable parts of a page or the full page.  With a positive
prefix argument, it always displays the readable parts, and with a zero
or negative prefix, it always displays the full page.

+++
*** New option 'eww-readable-urls'.
This is a list of regular expressions matching the URLs where EWW should
display only the readable parts by default.  For more details, see
"(eww) Basics" in the EWW manual.

---
*** New option 'eww-readable-adds-to-history'.
When non-nil (the default), calling 'eww-readable' adds a new entry to
the EWW page history.

** Go-ts mode

+++
*** New command 'go-ts-mode-docstring'.
This command adds a docstring comment to the current defun.  If a
comment already exists, point is only moved to the comment.  It is
bound to 'C-c C-d' in 'go-ts-mode'.

** Man mode

+++
*** New user option 'Man-prefer-synchronous-call'.
When this is non-nil, run the 'man' command synchronously rather than
asynchronously (which is the default behavior).

+++
*** New user option 'Man-support-remote-systems'.
This option controls whether the man page is formatted on the remote
system when the current buffer's default-directory is remote.  You can
invoke the 'man' command with a prefix argument to countermand the
value of this option for the current invocation of 'man'.

** DocView

---
*** New face 'doc-view-svg-face'.
This replaces 'doc-view-svg-foreground' and 'doc-view-svg-background'.
If you don't like the colors produced by the default definition of
this new face when DocView displays documents, customize this face to
restore the colors you were used to, or to get colors more to your
liking.

---
*** DocView buffers now display a new tool bar.
This tool bar contains options for searching and navigating within the
document, replacing the incompatible items for incremental search and
editing within the default tool bar displayed in the past.

** Shortdoc

+++
*** New function 'shortdoc-function-examples'.
This function returns examples of use of a given Emacs Lisp function
from the available shortdoc information.

+++
*** New function 'shortdoc-help-fns-examples-function'.
This function inserts into the current buffer examples of use of a
given Emacs Lisp function, which it gleans from the shortdoc
information.  If you want 'describe-function' ('C-h f') to insert
examples of using the function into regular "*Help*" buffers, add the
following to your init file:

    (add-hook 'help-fns-describe-function-functions
              #'shortdoc-help-fns-examples-function)

** Package

---
*** New user option 'package-vc-register-as-project'.
When non-nil, it will automatically register every package as a
project, that you can quickly select using 'project-switch-project'
('C-x p p').

---
*** New user option 'package-vc-allow-build-commands'.
Controls for which packages Emacs runs extra build commands when
installing directly from the package VCS repository.

---
*** New command 'package-vc-log-incoming'.
This commands displays incoming changes for a VC package without
modifying the current checkout.

---
*** New command to start an inferior Emacs loading only specific packages.
The new command 'package-isolate' will start a new Emacs process, as
a sub-process of Emacs where you invoke the command, in a way that
causes the new process to load only some of the installed packages.
The command prompts for the packages to activate in this
sub-process, and is intended for testing Emacs and/or the packages
in a clean environment.

** Flymake

+++
*** New user option 'flymake-indicator-type'.
This user option controls which error indicator type Flymake should use
in current buffer.  Depending on your preference, this can either use
fringes or margins for indicating errors.

+++
*** New user option 'flymake-margin-indicators-string'.
It controls, for each error type, the string and its face to display as
the margin indicator.

+++
*** New user option 'flymake-autoresize-margins'.
If non-nil, Flymake will resize the margins when 'flymake-mode' is
turned on or off.
Only relevant if 'flymake-indicator-type' is set to 'margins'.

+++
*** New user option 'flymake-margin-indicator-position'.
It controls which margin (left or right) is used for margin
indicators.

+++
*** New user option 'flymake-show-diagnostics-at-end-of-line'.
When non-nil, Flymake shows summarized descriptions of diagnostics at
the end of the line.  Depending on your preference, this can either be
distracting and easily confused with actual code, or a significant
early aid that relieves you from moving the buffer or reaching for the
mouse to consult an error message.

** Flyspell

*** New user option 'flyspell-check-changes'.
When non-nil, Flyspell mode spell-checks only words that you edited; it
does not check unedited words just because you move point across them.

** JS mode.
The binding 'M-.' has been removed from the major mode keymaps in
'js-mode' and 'js-ts-mode', having it default to the global binding
which calls 'xref-find-definitions'.  If the previous one worked
better for you, use 'define-key' in your init script to bind
'js-find-symbol' to that combination again.

** Json mode.
'js-json-mode' does not derive from 'js-mode' any more so as not
to confuse tools like Eglot or YASnippet into thinking that those
buffers contain Javascript code.

** Python mode

---
*** New user option 'python-indent-block-paren-deeper'.
If non-nil, increase the indentation of the lines inside parens in a
header of a block when they are indented to the same level as the body
of the block:

    if (some_expression
            and another_expression):
        do_something()

instead of:

    if (some_expression
        and another_expression):
        do_something()

*** New user option 'python-interpreter-args'.
This allows the user to specify command line arguments to the non
interactive Python interpreter specified by 'python-interpreter'.

*** New function 'python-shell-send-block'.
It sends the python block delimited by 'python-nav-beginning-of-block'
and 'python-nav-end-of-block' to the inferior Python process.

*** 'eldoc' no longer truncates to a single line by default.
Previously, the entire docstring was not available to eldoc, which made
'eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p' ineffective.  The old behavior may be
kept by customizing 'eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p'.

** Inferior Python mode

---
*** Default value of 'python-shell-compilation-regexp-alist' is changed.
Support for Python's ExceptionGroup has been added, so in the Python
shell, the line indicating the source of error in the error messages
from ExceptionGroup will be recognized as well.

** Scheme mode
Scheme mode now handles regular expression literal '#/regexp/' that is
available in some Scheme implementations.
Also, it should now handle nested sexp-comments.

** Use package

+++
*** New ':vc' keyword.
This keyword enables the user to install packages using 'package-vc'.

+++
*** New user option 'use-package-vc-prefer-newest'.
This allows the user to always install the newest commit of a package
when using the ':vc' keyword.

** Gnus

+++
*** New backend 'nnfeed'.
This allows backend developers to easily create new backends for web
feeds, as inheriting backends of 'nnfeed'.

+++
*** New backend 'nnatom'.
This allow users to add Atom Syndication Format feeds to Gnus as
servers.

*** The 'nnweb-type' option 'gmane' has been removed.
The gmane.org website is, sadly, down since a number of years with no
prospect of it coming back.  Therefore, it is no longer valid to set
the user option 'nnweb-type' to 'gmane'.

---
*** New user option 'gnus-mode-line-logo'.
This allows the user to either disable the display of any logo or
specify which logo will be displayed as part of the
buffer-identification in the mode-line of Gnus buffers.

** Rmail

---
*** New commands for reading mailing lists.
The new Rmail commands 'rmail-mailing-list-post',
'rmail-mailing-list-unsubscribe', 'rmail-mailing-list-help', and
'rmail-mailing-list-archive' allow, respectively, posting to,
unsubscribing from, requesting help about, and browsing the archives
of, the mailing list from which the current email message was
delivered.

** Dictionary

---
*** New user option 'dictionary-search-interface'.
Controls how the 'dictionary-search' command prompts for and displays
dictionary definitions.  Customize this user option to 'help' to have
'dictionary-search' display definitions in a "*Help*" buffer and
provide dictionary-based minibuffer completion for word selection.

---
*** New user option 'dictionary-read-word-prompt'.
This allows the user to customize the prompt that is used by
'dictionary-search' when asking for a word to search in the
dictionary.

---
*** New user option 'dictionary-display-definition-function'.
This allows the user to customize the way in which 'dictionary-search'
displays word definitions.  If non-nil, this user option should be set
to a function that displays a word definition obtained from a
dictionary server.  The new function
'dictionary-display-definition-in-help-buffer' can be used to display
the definition in a "*Help*" buffer, instead of the default
"*Dictionary*" buffer.

---
*** New user option 'dictionary-read-word-function'.
This allows the user to customize the way in which 'dictionary-search'
prompts for a word to search in the dictionary.  This user option
should be set to a function that lets the user select a word and
returns it as a string.  The new function
'dictionary-completing-read-word' can be used to prompt with
completion based on dictionary matches.

---
*** New user option 'dictionary-read-dictionary-function'.
This allows the user to customize the way in which 'dictionary-search'
prompts for a dictionary to search in.  This user option should be set
to a function that lets the user select a dictionary and returns its
name as a string.  The new function
'dictionary-completing-read-dictionary' can be used to prompt with
completion based on dictionaries that the server supports.

---
*** The default value of 'dictionary-tooltip-dictionary' has changed.
The new default value is t, which means use the same dictionary as the
value of 'dictionary-default-dictionary'.  The previous default value
was nil, which effectively disabled 'dictionary-tooltip-mode', even if
the mode was turned on.

** Pp

*** New 'pp-default-function' user option replaces 'pp-use-max-width'.

*** New default pretty printing function, which tries to obey 'fill-column'.

*** 'pp-to-string' takes an additional PP-FUNCTION argument.
This argument specifies the prettifying algorithm to use.

** Emacs Lisp mode

---
*** ',@' now has 'prefix' syntax.
Previously, the '@' character, which normally has 'symbol' syntax,
would combine with a following Lisp symbol and interfere with symbol
searching.

---
*** 'emacs-lisp-docstring-fill-column' now defaults to 72.
It was previously 65.  The new default formats documentation strings to
fit on fewer lines without negatively impacting readability.

** CPerl mode

---
*** Subroutine signatures are now supported.
CPerl mode fontifies subroutine signatures like variable declarations
which makes them visually distinct from subroutine prototypes.

*** Syntax of Perl up to version 5.40 is supported.
CPerl mode supports the new keywords for exception handling and the
object oriented syntax which were added in Perl 5.36, 5.38 and 5.40.

*** New user option 'cperl-fontify-trailer'.
This user option takes the values 'perl-code' or 'comment' and treats
text after an "__END__" or "__DATA__" token accordingly.  The default
value of 'perl-code' is useful for trailing POD and for AutoSplit
modules, the value 'comment' makes CPerl mode treat trailers as
comment, like Perl mode does.

*** New command 'cperl-file-style'.
This command sets the indentation style for the current buffer.  To
change the default style, either use the user option with the same name
or use the command 'cperl-set-style'.

*** New minor mode cperl-extra-paired-delimiters-mode
Perl 5.36 and newer allows using more than 200 non-ASCII paired
delimiters for quote-like constructs, eg. "q«text»".  Use this minor
mode in buffers where this feature is activated.

*** Commands using the Perl info page are obsolete.
The Perl documentation in info format is no longer distributed with
Perl or on CPAN since more than 10 years.  Perl documentation can be
read with 'cperl-perldoc' instead.

*** Highlighting trailing whitespace has been removed.
The user option 'cperl-invalid-face' is now obsolete, and does
nothing.  See the user option 'show-trailing-whitespace' instead.

** Emacs Sessions (Desktop)

+++
*** Restoring buffers visiting remote files can now time out.
When a buffer is restored which visits a remote file, the restoration
of the session could hang if the remote host is off-line or slow to
respond.  Setting the user option 'remote-file-name-access-timeout' to
a positive number will abandon the attempt to restore such buffers
after a timeout of that many seconds, thus allowing the rest of
desktop restoration to continue.

** Recentf

+++
*** Checking recent remote files can now time out.
Similarly to buffer restoration by Desktop, 'recentf-mode' checking
of the accessibility of remote files can now time out if
'remote-file-name-access-timeout' is set to a positive number.

** Notifications

+++
*** Allow using Icon Naming Specification for ':app-icon'.
You can use a symbol as the value for ':app-icon' to provide icon name
without specifying a file, like this:

    (notifications-notify
      :title "I am playing music" :app-icon 'multimedia-player)

** Image

+++
*** Image ':map' property is now recomputed when image is transformed.
Now images with clickable maps work as expected after you run commands
such as 'image-increase-size', 'image-decrease-size', 'image-rotate',
'image-flip-horizontally', and 'image-flip-vertically'.

+++
*** New user option 'image-recompute-map-p'.
Set this option to nil to prevent Emacs from recomputing image maps.

** Image Dired

*** New user option 'image-dired-thumb-naming'.
You can now configure how a thumbnail is named using this option.

** ERT

+++
*** New macro 'skip-when' to skip 'ert-deftest' tests.
This can help avoid some awkward skip conditions.  For example
'(skip-unless (not noninteractive))' can be changed to the easier
to read '(skip-when noninteractive)'.

+++
*** Syntax highlighting unit testing support.
An ERT extension ('ert-font-lock') now provides support for face
assignment unit testing.  For more information, see the "(ert) Syntax
Highlighting Tests" node in the ERT manual.

** URL

+++
*** 'url-gateway-broken-resolution' is now obsolete.
This option was intended for use on SunOS 4.x and Ultrix systems,
neither of which have been supported by Emacs since version 23.1.
The user option 'url-gateway-nslookup-program' and the function
'url-gateway-nslookup-host' are consequently also obsolete.

** Socks

+++
*** Socks supports version 4a.
The 'socks-server' user option accepts '4a' as a value for its version
field.

** Edmacro

+++
*** New command 'edmacro-set-macro-to-region-lines'.
Bound to 'C-c C-r', this command replaces the macro text with the
lines of the region.  If needed, the region is extended to include
whole lines.  If the region ends at the beginning of a line, that last
line is excluded.

+++
*** New user option 'edmacro-reverse-macro-lines'.
When this is non-nil, the lines of key sequences are displayed with
the most recent line first.  This is can be useful when working with
macros with many lines, such as from 'kmacro-edit-lossage'.

** Proced

---
*** More control on automatic update of Proced buffers.
The user option 'proced-auto-update-flag' can now be set to 2 additional
values, which control automatic updates of Proced buffers that are not
displayed in some window.

** Kmacro

+++
*** New Advanced Macro Counter functions.
New commands have been added to implement advanced macro counter
functions.

The commands 'C-x C-k C-r l' and 'C-x C-k C-r s' load and save the
macro counter from and to a number register, respectively.

The commands 'C-x C-k C-r a =', 'C-x C-k C-r a <', and
'C-x C-k C-r a >' compare the macro counter with the contents of a
number register and increment the counter by an optional prefix if the
comparison succeeds.

The commands 'C-x C-k C-q =', 'C-x C-k C-q <', and 'C-x C-k C-q >'
compare the macro counter with an optional prefix and terminate the
macro if the comparison succeeds.

** Kmacro Menu mode

+++
*** New mode 'kmacro-menu-mode' and new command 'list-keyboard-macros'.
The new command 'list-keyboard-macros' is the keyboard-macro version
of commands like 'list-buffers' and 'list-processes', creating a listing
of the currently existing keyboards macros using the new mode
'kmacro-menu-mode'.  It allows rearranging the macros in the ring,
duplicating them, deleting them, and editing their counters, formats,
and keys.

** Customize

+++
*** New command 'customize-dirlocals'.
This command pops up a buffer to edit the settings in ".dir-locals.el".

---
*** New command 'customize-toggle-option'.
This command can toggle boolean options for the duration of a session.

** Calc

+++
*** Calc parses fractions written using U+2044 FRACTION SLASH.
Fractions of the form "123⁄456" are handled as if written "123:456".
Note in particular the difference in behavior from U+2215 DIVISION SLASH
and U+002F SOLIDUS, which result in division rather than a rational
fraction.  You may also be interested to know that precomposed fraction
characters, such as ½ (U+00BD VULGAR FRACTION ONE HALF), are also
recognized as rational fractions.  They have been since 2004, but it
looks like it was never mentioned in the NEWS, or even the manual.

** IELM

---
*** IELM now remembers input history between sessions.
The new user option 'ielm-history-file-name' is the name of the file
where IELM input history will be saved.  Customize it to nil to revert
to the old behavior of not remembering input history between sessions.

** EasyPG

+++
*** New user option 'epa-keys-select-method'.
This allows the user to customize the key selection method, which can be
either by using a pop-up buffer or from the minibuffer.  The pop-up
buffer method is the default, which preserves previous behavior.

** Xwidget Webkit

+++
*** New user option 'xwidget-webkit-disable-javascript'.
This allows disabling JavaScript in xwidget Webkit sessions.

** Ls Lisp

---
*** 'ls-lisp--insert-directory' supports more long options of 'ls'.
'ls-lisp--insert-directory', the ls-lisp implementation of
'insert-directory', now supports the '--time=TIME' and '--sort=time'
options of GNU 'ls'.

** Widget

+++
*** New face 'widget-unselected'.
Customize this face to a non-default value to visually distinguish the
labels of unselected active radio-button or checkbox widgets from the
labels of unselected inactive widgets (the default value inherits from
the 'widget-inactive' face).

*** New user option 'widget-skip-inactive'.
If non-nil, moving point forward or backward between widgets by typing
'TAB' or 'S-TAB' skips over inactive widgets.  The default value is nil.

** Xref

*** 'xref-revert-buffer' is now an alias of 'revert-buffer'.
The Xref buffer now sets up 'revert-buffer-function' such that
'revert-buffer' behaves like 'xref-revert-buffer' did in previous Emacs
versions, and the latter is now an alias of the former.

** Ruby mode

*** New user option 'ruby-rubocop-use-bundler'.
By default it retains the previous behavior: read the contents of
Gemfile and act accordingly.  But you can also set it to t or nil to
skip the check.

** Thingatpt

---
*** New variables for providing custom thingatpt implementations.
The new variables 'bounds-of-thing-at-point-provider-alist' and
'forward-thing-provider-alist' now allow defining custom implementations
of 'bounds-of-thing-at-point' and 'forward-thing', respectively.

---
*** New helper functions for text property-based thingatpt providers.
The new helper functions 'thing-at-point-for-char-property',
'bounds-of-thing-at-point-for-char-property', and
'forward-thing-for-char-property' can help to help implement custom
thingatpt providers for "things" that are defined by a text property.

---
*** 'bug-reference-mode' now supports 'thing-at-point'.
Now, calling '(thing-at-point 'url)' when point is on a bug reference
will return the URL for that bug.

** Miscellaneous

---
*** Webjump now assumes URIs are HTTPS instead of HTTP.
For links in 'webjump-sites' without an explicit URI scheme, it was
previously assumed that they should be prefixed with "http://".  Such
URIs are now prefixed with "https://" instead.

+++
*** New user option 'rcirc-log-time-format'.
This allows for rcirc logs to use a custom timestamp format, than the
chat buffers use by default.

---
*** New user option 'Buffer-menu-group-by'.
It controls how buffers are divided into groups that are displayed with
headings using Outline minor mode.  Using commands that mark buffers
on the outline heading line will mark all buffers in the outline.

+++
*** New command 'Buffer-menu-toggle-internal'.
This command toggles the display of internal buffers in Buffer Menu mode;
that is, buffers not visiting a file and whose names start with a space.
Previously, such buffers were never shown.  This command is bound to 'I'
in Buffer Menu mode.

---
*** nXML Mode now comes with schemas for Mono/.NET development.
The following new XML schemas are now supported:
- MSBuild project files
- Dotnet package properties files
- Dotnet resource extension files
- Dotnet Application config files
- Nuget config file
- Nuget package specification file
- Nuget packages config file

*** color.el now supports the Oklab color representation.

---
*** 'M-x ping' can now give "ping" additional flags.
Typing 'C-u M-x ping' prompts first for the host, and then for the flags
to give to "ping".


* New Modes and Packages in Emacs 31.1


* Incompatible Lisp Changes in Emacs 31.1


* Lisp Changes in Emacs 31.1


* Changes in Emacs 30.1 on Non-Free Operating Systems

** MS-Windows

+++
*** You can now opt out of following MS-Windows' Dark mode.
By default, Emacs on MS-Windows follows the system's Dark mode for its
title bars' and scroll bars' appearance.  If the new user option
'w32-follow-system-dark-mode' is customized to the nil value, Emacs
will disregard the system's Dark mode and will always use the default
Light mode.

---
*** You can now use Image-Dired even if 'convert' command is not installed.
If you don't have GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick installed, and thus the
'gm convert'/'convert' command is not available, Emacs on MS-Windows
will now use its own function 'w32image-create-thumbnail' to create
thumbnail images and show them in the thumbnail buffer.  Unlike with
using 'convert', this fallback method is synchronous, so Emacs will wait
until all the thumbnails are created and displayed, before showing them.

---
*** Emacs on MS-Windows now supports the ':stipple' face attribute.
