* Installation Changes in Emacs 29.1

** Emacs has been ported to the Haiku operating system.
The configuration process should automatically detect and build for
Haiku.  There is also an optional window-system port to Haiku, which
can be enabled by configuring Emacs with the option '--with-be-app',
which will require the Haiku Application Kit development headers and a
C++ compiler to be present on your system.  If Emacs is not built with
the option '--with-be-app', the resulting Emacs will only run in
text-mode terminals.

+++
*** Cairo drawing support has been enabled for Haiku builds.
To enable Cairo support, ensure that the Cairo and FreeType
development files are present on your system, and configure Emacs with
'--with-be-cairo'.

---
*** Double buffering is now enabled on the Haiku operating system.
Unlike X, there is no compile-time option to enable or disable
double-buffering.  If you wish to disable double-buffering, change the
frame parameter 'inhibit-double-buffering' instead.

** Emacs now installs the ".pdmp" file using a unique fingerprint in the name.
The file is typically installed using a file name akin to
"...dir/libexec/emacs/29.1/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/emacs-<fingerprint>.pdmp".
If a constant file name is required, the file can be renamed to
"emacs.pdmp", and Emacs will find it during startup anyway.

** Emacs now supports use of XInput 2 for input events.
If your X server has support and you have the XInput 2 development headers
installed, you can configure Emacs with the option '--with-xinput2' to enable
this support.

The named feature 'xinput2' can be used to test for the presence of
XInput 2 support from Lisp programs.


* Startup Changes in Emacs 29.1

+++
** Emacs now has a '--fingerprint' option.
This will output a string identifying the current Emacs build.

+++
** New hook 'after-pdump-load-hook'.
This is run at the end of the Emacs startup process, and it meant to
be used to reinitialize structures that would normally be done at load
time.


* Incompatible changes in Emacs 29.1

---
** 'C-x 8 .' has been moved to 'C-x 8 . .'.
This is to open up the 'C-x 8 .' map to bind further characters there.

---
** The mode line now uses a proportional font by default.
To get the old monospaced mode line back, customize the
'mode-line-active' and 'mode-line-inactive' faces not to inherit from
the 'variable-pitch' face, or add this to your "~/.emacs":

  (set-face-attribute 'mode-line-active nil :inherit 'mode-line)
  (set-face-attribute 'mode-line-inactive nil :inherit 'mode-line)


* Changes in Emacs 29.1

---
** 'write-file' will now copy some file mode bits.
If the current buffer is visiting a file that is executable, the
'C-x C-w' command will now make the new file executable, too.

+++
** New user option 'process-error-pause-time'.
This determines how long to pause Emacs after a process
filter/sentinel error has been handled.

+++
** New face 'variable-pitch-text'.
This face is like 'variable-pitch' (from which it inherits), but is
slightly larger, which should help with the visual size differences
between the default, non-proportional font and proportional fonts when
mixed.

+++
** New face 'mode-line-active'.
This inherits from the 'mode-line' face, but is the face actually used
on the mode lines (along with 'mode-line-inactive').

+++
** New function 'buffer-text-pixel-size'.
This is similar to 'window-text-pixel-size', but can be used when the
buffer isn't displayed.

+++
** New X resource: "borderThickness".
This controls the thickness of the external borders of the menu bars
and pop-up menus.

---
** New minor mode 'pixel-scroll-precision-mode'.
When enabled, and if your mouse supports it, you can scroll the
display up or down at pixel resolution, according to what your mouse
wheel reports.  Unlike 'pixel-scroll-mode', this mode scrolls the
display pixel-by-pixel, as opposed to only animating line-by-line
scrolls.

** Terminal Emacs

---
*** Emacs will now use 24-bit colors on terminals that support "Tc" capability.
This is in addition to previously-supported ways of discovering 24-bit
color support: either via the "RGB" or "setf24" capabilities, or if
the 'COLORTERM' environment variable is set to the value "truecolor".

** ERT

+++
*** New ERT variables 'ert-batch-print-length' and 'ert-batch-print-level'.
These variables will override 'print-length' and 'print-level' when
printing Lisp values in ERT batch test results.

---
*** Redefining an ERT test in batch mode now signals an error.
Executing 'ert-deftest' with the same name as an existing test causes
the previous definition to be discarded, which was probably not
intended when this occurs in batch mode.  To remedy the error, rename
tests so that they all have unique names.

** Emoji

+++
*** Emacs now has several new methods for inserting Emojis.
The Emoji commands are under the new 'C-x 8 e' prefix.

+++
*** New command 'emoji-insert' (bound to 'C-x 8 e e' and 'C-x 8 e i').
This command guides you through various Emoji categories and
combinations in a graphical menu system.

+++
*** New command 'emoji-search' (bound to 'C-x 8 e s').
This command lets you search for Emojis based on names.

+++
*** New command 'emoji-list' (bound to 'C-x 8 e l').
This command lists all Emojis (categorized by themes) in a special
buffer and lets you choose one of them.

---
*** New command 'emoji-recent' (bound to 'C-x 8 e r').
This command lets you choose among the Emojis you have recently
inserted.

+++
*** New command 'emoji-describe' (bound to 'C-x 8 e d').
This command will tell you the name of the Emoji at point.  (This
command also works for non-Emoji characters.)

** Help

---
*** 'C-h b' uses outlining by default.
Set 'describe-bindings-outline' to nil to get the old behavior.

---
*** Jumping to function/variable source now saves mark before moving point.
Jumping to source from "*Help*" buffer moves the point when the source
buffer is already open.  Now, the old point is pushed to mark ring.

+++
*** New key bindings in "*Help*" buffers: 'n' and 'p'.
These will take you (respectively) to the next and previous "page".

---
*** 'describe-char' now also outputs the name of emoji combinations.

** Outline Minor Mode

+++
*** New user option 'outline-minor-mode-use-buttons'.
If non-nil, Outline Minor Mode will use buttons to hide/show outlines
in addition to the ellipsis.  Default nil.

---
*** New user option 'outline-minor-mode-buttons'.
This is a list of pairs of open/close strings used to display buttons.

+++
** Support for the WebP image format.
This support is built by default when the libwebp library is
available.  To disable it, use the '--without-webp' configure flag.
Image specifiers can now use ':type webp'.

** Windows

+++
*** 'display-buffer' now can set up the body size of the chosen window.
For example, a 'display-buffer-alist' entry of

    '(window-width . (body-columns . 40))'

will make the body of the chosen window 40 columns wide.  For the
height use 'window-height' in combination with 'body-lines'.

** Tab Bars and Tab Lines

---
*** 'C-x t RET' creates a new tab when the provided tab name doesn't exist.

** Better detection of text suspiciously reordered on display.
The function 'bidi-find-overridden-directionality' has been extended
to detect reordering effects produced by embeddings and isolates
(started by directional formatting control characters such as RLO and
LRI).  The new command 'highlight-confusing-reorderings' finds and
highlights segments of buffer text whose reordering for display is
suspicious and could be malicious.

** Emacs server and client changes

+++
*** New command-line option '-r' for emacsclient.
With this command-line option, Emacs reuses an existing graphical client
frame if one exists; otherwise it creates a new frame.

+++
*** 'server-stop-automatically' can be used to automatically stop the server.
The Emacs server will be automatically stopped when certain conditions
are met.  The conditions are given by the argument, which can be
'empty', 'delete-frame' or 'kill-terminal'.

* Editing Changes in Emacs 29.1

---
** Indentation of 'cl-flet' and 'cl-labels' has changed.
These forms now indent like this:

    (cl-flet ((bla (x)
		(* x x)))
      (bla 42))

This change also affects 'cl-macrolet', 'cl-flet*' and
'cl-symbol-macrolet'.

+++
** New user option 'translate-upper-case-key-bindings'.
This can be set to nil to inhibit translating upper case keys to lower
case keys.

+++
** New command 'ensure-empty-lines'.
This command increases (or decreases) the number of empty lines before
point.

---
*** Improved mouse behavior with auto-scrolling modes.
When clicking inside the 'scroll-margin' or 'hscroll-margin' region
the point is now moved only when releasing the mouse button.  This no
longer results in a bogus selection, unless the mouse has been
effectively dragged.

+++
** 'kill-ring-max' now defaults to 120.

---
** New user option 'yank-menu-max-items'.
Customize this option to limit the number of entries in the menu
"Edit->Paste from Kill Menu".  The default is 60.

** show-paren-mode

+++
*** New user option 'show-paren-context-when-offscreen'.
When non-nil, if the point is in a closing delimiter and the opening
delimiter is offscreen, shows some context around the opening
delimiter in the echo area.  Default nil.

** Comint

+++
*** 'comint-term-environment' is now aware of connection-local variables.
The user option 'comint-terminfo-terminal' and variable
'system-uses-terminfo' can now be set as connection-local variables to
change the terminal used on a remote host.

** Mwheel

---
*** New user options for alternate wheel events.
The options 'mouse-wheel-down-alternate-event', 'mouse-wheel-up-alternate-event',
'mouse-wheel-left-alternate-event', and 'mouse-wheel-right-alternate-event' have
been added to better support systems where two kinds of wheel events can be
received.


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 29.1

** New minor mode 'glyphless-display-mode'.
This allows an easy way to toggle seeing all glyphless characters in
the current buffer.

** Registers

+++
*** Buffer names can now be stored in registers.
For instance, to enable jumping to the "*Messages*" buffer with
'C-x r j m':

    (set-register ?m '(buffer . "*Messages*"))

** pixel-fill

+++
*** This is a new package that deals with filling variable-pitch text.

+++
*** New function 'pixel-fill-region'.
This fills the region to be no wider than a specified pixel width.

** Info

---
*** New command 'Info-goto-node-web' and key binding 'G'.
This will take you to the gnu.org web server's version of the current
info node.  This command only works for the Emacs and Emacs Lisp manuals.

** vc

---
*** 'C-x v v' on an unregistered file will now use the most specific backend.
Previously, if you had an SVN-covered "~/" directory, and a Git-covered
directory in "~/foo/bar", using 'C-x v v' on a new, unregistered file
"~/foo/bar/zot" would register it in the SVN repository in "~/" instead of
in the Git repository in "~/foo/bar".  This makes this command
consistent with 'vc-responsible-backend'.

** Message

---
*** New user option 'mml-attach-file-at-the-end'.
If non-nil, 'C-c C-a' will put attached files at the end of the message.

---
*** Message Mode now supports image yanking.

** HTML Mode

---
*** HTML Mode now supports "text/html" and "image/*" yanking.

** Texinfo Mode

---
*** 'texinfo-mode' now has a specialised 'narrow-to-defun' definition.
It narrows to the current node.

** eww/shr

+++
*** New user option 'shr-use-xwidgets-for-media'.
If non-nil (and Emacs has been built with support for xwidgets),
display <video> elements with an xwidget.  Note that this is
experimental, and is known to crash Emacs on some systems, and just
doesn't work on other systems.  Also see etc/PROBLEMS.

+++
*** New user option 'eww-url-transformers'.
These are used to alter an URL before using it.  By default it removes
the common "utm_" trackers from URLs.

** Gnus

---
*** Gnus now uses a variable-pitch font in the headers by default.
To get the monospace font back, you can put something like the
following in your .gnus file:

    (set-face-attribute 'gnus-header nil :inherit 'unspecified)

---
*** The default value of 'gnus-treat-fold-headers' is now 'head'.

---
*** New face 'gnus-header'.
All other 'gnus-header-*' faces inherit from this face now.

+++
*** New user option 'gnus-treat-emojize-symbols'.
If non-nil, symbols that have an emoji representation will be
displayed as emojis.  Default nil.

+++
*** New command 'gnus-article-emojize-symbols'.
This is bound to 'W D e' and will display symbols that have emoji
representation as emojis.

** EIEIO

+++
*** 'slot-value' can now be used to read slots of 'cl-defstruct' objects.

** align

---
*** Alignment in 'text-mode' has changed.
Previously, 'M-x align' didn't do anything, and you had to say 'C-u
M-x align' for it to work.  This has now been changed.  The default
regexp for 'C-u M-x align-regexp' has also been changed to be easier
for inexperienced users to use.

** eww

+++
*** New user option to automatically rename EWW buffers.
The 'eww-auto-rename-buffer' user option can be configured to rename
rendered web pages by using their title, URL, or a user-defined
function which returns a string.  For the first two cases, the length
of the resulting name is controlled by 'eww-buffer-name-length'.  By
default, no automatic renaming is performed.

** Help

*** New user option 'help-link-key-to-documentation'.
When this option is non-nil (which is the default), key bindings
displayed in the "*Help*" buffer will be linked to the documentation
for the command they are bound to.  This does not affect listings of
key bindings and functions (such as 'C-h b').

** info-look

---
*** info-look specs can now be expanded at run time instead of a load time.
The new ':doc-spec-function' element can be used to compute the
':doc-spec' element when the user asks for info on that particular
mode (instead of at load time).

** subr-x

+++
*** New macro 'with-memoization' provides a very primitive form of memoization.

** ansi-color

---
*** Support for ANSI 256-color and 24-bit colors.
256-color and 24-bit color codes are now handled by ANSI color
filters and displayed with the specified color.

** term-mode

---
*** Support for ANSI 256-color and 24-bit colors, italic and other fonts.
Term-mode can now display 256-color and 24-bit color codes.  It can
also handle ANSI codes for faint, italic and blinking text, displaying
it with new 'term-{faint,italic,slow-blink,fast-blink}' faces.

** Xref

*** 'project-find-file' and 'project-or-external-find-file' now accept
a prefix argument which is interpreted to mean "include all files".

*** 'project-kill-buffers' can display the list of buffers to kill.
Customize the user option 'project-kill-buffers-display-buffer-list'
to enable the display of the buffer list.

+++
*** New command 'xref-go-forward'.
It is bound to 'C-M-,' and jumps to the location where 'xref-go-back'
('M-,', also known as 'xref-pop-marker-stack') was invoked previously.

** File notifications

+++
*** The new command 'file-notify-rm-all-watches' removes all file notifications.

** Sql

---
*** Sql now supports sending of passwords in-process.
To improve security, if an sql product has ':password-in-comint' set
to t, a password supplied via the minibuffer will be sent in-process,
as opposed to via the command-line.

** Image Mode

+++
*** New command 'image-transform-fit-to-window'.
This command fits the image to the current window by scaling down or
up as necessary.  Unlike 'image-transform-fit-both', this does not
only scale the image down, but up as well.  It is bound to "s w" in
Image Mode by default.

+++
*** 'image-transform-fit-to-(height|width)' are now obsolete.
Use the new command 'image-transform-fit-to-window' instead.
The keybinding for 'image-transform-fit-to-width' is now 's i'.

---
*** User option 'image-auto-resize' can now be set to 'fit-window'.
This works like 'image-transform-fit-to-window'.

*** New user option 'image-auto-resize-max-scale-percent'.
The new 'fit-window' option will never scale an image more than this
much (in percent).  It is nil by default, which means no limit.

---
*** New user option 'image-text-based-formats'.
This controls whether or not to show a message when opening certain
image formats saying how to edit it as text.  The default is to show
this message for SVG and XPM.

** Image-Dired

+++
*** 'image-dired-display-image-mode' is now based on 'image-mode'.
This avoids converting images in the background, and makes Image-Dired
noticeably faster.  New keybindings from 'image-mode' are now
available in the "*image-dired-display-image*" buffer; press '?' or
'h' in that buffer to see the full list.  Finally, some commands and
user options that are no longer needed are now obsolete:
'image-dired-cmd-create-temp-image-options',
'image-dired-cmd-create-temp-image-program',
'image-dired-display-current-image-full',
'image-dired-display-current-image-sized',
'image-dired-display-window-height-correction',
'image-dired-display-window-width-correction',
'image-dired-temp-image-file'.

---
*** Reduce dependency on external "exiftool" command.
The 'image-dired-copy-with-exif-file-name' no longer requires an
external "exiftool" command to be available.  The user options
'image-dired-cmd-read-exif-data-program' and
'image-dired-cmd-read-exif-data-options' are now obsolete.

---
*** New command for the thumbnail buffer.
The new command 'image-dired-unmark-all-marks' has been added.  It is
bound to 'U' in the thumbnail buffer.

---
*** Support Thumbnail Managing Standard v0.9.0 (Dec 2020).
This standard allows sharing generated thumbnails across different
programs.  Version 0.9.0 adds two larger thumbnail sizes: 512x512 and
1024x1024 pixels.  See the user option 'image-dired-thumbnail-storage'
to use it; it is not enabled by default.

---
*** Support GraphicsMagick command line tools.
Support for the GraphicsMagick command line tool ("gm") has been
added, and is used instead of ImageMagick when it is available.

---
*** New face 'image-dired-thumb-flagged'.
If 'image-dired-thumb-mark' is non-nil (the default), this face is
used for images that are flagged for deletion in the Dired buffer
associated with Image-Dired.

---
*** The 'image-dired-slideshow-start' command has been revamped.
It no longer inconveniently prompts for a number of images and a
delay: it runs indefinitely, but stops automatically on any command.
You can set the delay with a prefix argument, or a negative prefix
argument to prompt anyways.  Customize the user option
'image-dired-slideshow-delay' to change the default, which is 5
seconds.  It is bound to 'S' in the thumbnail and display buffer.

---
*** Support for bookmark.el.
The command 'bookmark-set' (bound to 'C-x r m') is now supported in
the thumbnail view, and will create a bookmark that opens the current
directory in Image-Dired.

+++
*** 'image-dired-show-all-from-dir-max-files' has been increased to 500.
This option controls asking for confirmation when starting Image-Dired
in a directory with many files.  However, Image-Dired creates
thumbnails in the background these days, so this is not as important
as it used to be, back when entering a large directory could lock up
Emacs for tens of seconds.  In addition, you can now customize this
option to nil to disable this confirmation completely.

---
*** Make 'image-dired-rotate-thumbnail-(left|right)' obsolete.
Instead, use 'M-x image-dired-refresh-thumb' to generate a new
thumbnail, or 'M-x image-rotate' to rotate the thumbnail without
updating the thumbnail file.

** Dired

*** New user option 'dired-free-space'.
Dired will now, by default, include the free space in the first line
instead of having it on a separate line.  To get the previous behavior
back, say:

    (setq dired-free-space 'separate)

---
*** New user option 'dired-make-directory-clickable'.
If non-nil (which is the default), hitting 'RET' or 'mouse-1' on
the directory components at the directory displayed at the start of
the buffer will take you to that directory.

** Exif

*** New function 'exif-field'.
This is a convenience function to extract the field data from
'exif-parse-file' and 'exif-parse-buffer'.

** Xwidgets

---
*** New user option 'xwidget-webkit-buffer-name-format'.
Using this option you can control how the xwidget-webkit buffers are
named.

---
*** New user option 'xwidget-webkit-cookie-file'.
Using this option you can control whether the xwidget-webkit buffers
save cookies set by web pages, and if so, in which file to save them.

+++
*** New minor mode 'xwidget-webkit-edit-mode'.
When this mode is enabled, self-inserting characters and other common
web browser shortcut keys are redefined to send themselves to the
WebKit widget.

+++
*** New minor mode 'xwidget-webkit-isearch-mode'.
This mode acts similarly to incremental search, and allows searching
the contents of a WebKit widget.  In xwidget-webkit mode, it is bound
to 'C-s' and 'C-r'.

+++
*** New command 'xwidget-webkit-browse-history'.
This command displays a buffer containing the page load history of
the current WebKit widget, and allows you to navigate it.

---
*** On X11, the WebKit inspector is now available inside xwidgets.
To access the inspector, right click on the widget and select "Inspect
Element".

---
*** "Open in New Window" in a WebKit widget's context menu now works.
The newly created buffer will be displayed via 'display-buffer', which
can be customized through the usual mechanism of 'display-buffer-alist'
and friends.

** Tramp

---
*** Tramp supports abbreviating remote home directories now.
When calling 'abbreviate-file-name' on a Tramp filename, the result
will abbreviate the user's home directory, for example by abbreviating
"/ssh:user@host:/home/user" to "/ssh:user@host:~".


* New Modes and Packages in Emacs 29.1

+++
** New mode 'erts-mode'.
This mode is used to edit files geared towards testing actions in
Emacs buffers, like indentation and the like.  The new ert function
'ert-test-erts-file' is used to parse these files.


* Incompatible Lisp Changes in Emacs 29.1

** Fonts

---
*** Emacs now supports 'medium' fonts.
Emacs previously didn't distinguish between the 'regular'/'normal'
weight and the 'medium' weight, but it now also supports the (heavier)
'medium' weight.  However, this means that if you previously specified
a weight of 'normal' and the font doesn't have this weight, Emacs
won't find the font spec.  In these cases, replacing ":weight 'normal"
with ":weight 'medium" should fix the issue.

** Keymap descriptions have changed.
'help--describe-command', 'C-h b' and associated functions that output
keymap descriptions have changed.  In particular, prefix commands are
not output at all, and instead of "??" for closures/functions,
"[closure]"/"[lambda]" is output.

---
** 'downcase' details have changed slightly.
In certain locales, changing the case of an ASCII-range character may
turn it into a multibyte character, most notably with "I" in Turkish
(the lowercase is "ı", 0x0131).  Previously, 'downcase' on a unibyte
string was buggy, and would mistakenly just return the lower byte of
this, 0x31 (the digit "1").  'downcase' on a unibyte string has now
been changed to downcase such characters as if they were ASCII.  To
get proper locale-dependent downcasing, the string has to be converted
to multibyte first.  (This goes for the other case-changing functions,
too.)

---
** Functions in 'tramp-foreign-file-name-handler-alist' have changed.
Functions to determine which Tramp file name handler to use are now
passed a file name in dissected form (via 'tramp-dissect-file-name')
instead of in string form.

---
** 'def' indentation changes.
In 'emacs-lisp-mode', forms with a symbol with a name that start with
"def" have been automatically indented as if they were 'defun'-like
forms, for instance:

    (defzot 1
      2 3)

This heuristic has now been removed, and all functions/macros that
want to be indented this way have to be marked with

    (declare (indent defun))

or the like.  If the function/macro definition itself can't be
changed, the indentation can also be adjusted by saying something
like:

    (put 'defzot 'lisp-indent-function 'defun)

---
** The 'inhibit-changing-match-data' variable is now obsolete.
Instead, functions like 'string-match' and 'looking-at' now take an
optional 'inhibit-modify' argument.

---
** 'gnus-define-keys' is now obsolete.
Use 'define-keymap' instead.

---
** MozRepl has been removed from js.el.
MozRepl was removed from Firefox in 2017, so this code doesn't work
with recent versions of Firefox.

---
** The function 'image-dired-get-exif-data' is now obsolete.
Use 'exif-parse-file' and 'exif-field' instead.

---
** 'insert-directory' alternatives should not change the free disk space line.
This change is now applied in 'dired-insert-directory'.

** Some functions and variables obsolete since Emacs 23 have been removed:
'find-emacs-lisp-shadows', 'newsticker--cache-read-version1',
'newsticker--cache-save-version1', 'newsticker--cache-update',
'newsticker-cache-filename', 'unify-8859-on-decoding-mode',
'unify-8859-on-encoding-mode', 'vc-arch-command'.


* Lisp Changes in Emacs 29.1

+++
** New function 'get-display-property'.
This is like 'get-text-property', but works on the 'display' text
property.

+++
** New function 'add-text-display-property'.
This is like 'put-text-property', but works on the 'display' text
property.

+++
** New 'min-width' 'display' property.
This allows setting a minimum display width for a region of text.

+++
** New event type 'touch-end'.
This event is sent whenever the user's finger moves off the mouse
wheel on some mice, or when the user's finger moves off the touchpad.

** Keymaps and key definitions

+++
*** New functions for defining and manipulating keystrokes have been added.
These all take just the syntax defined by 'key-valid-p'.  None of the
older functions have been depreciated or altered, but are deemphasised
in the documentation.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-set' instead of 'define-key'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-global-set' instead of 'global-set-key'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-local-set' instead of 'local-set-key'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-global-unset' instead of 'global-unset-key'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-local-unset' instead of 'local-unset-key'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-substitute' instead of 'substitute-key-definition'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-set-after' instead of 'define-key-after'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-lookup' instead of 'lookup-keymap' and 'key-binding'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-local-lookup' instead of 'local-key-binding'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-global-lookup' instead of 'global-key-binding'.

+++
*** 'define-key' now takes an optional REMOVE argument.
If non-nil, remove the definition from the keymap.  This is subtly
different from setting a definition to nil (when the keymap has a
parent).

+++
*** New function 'key-valid-p'.
The 'kbd' function is quite permissive, and will try to return
something usable even if the syntax of the argument isn't completely
correct.  The 'key-valid-p' predicate does a stricter check of the
syntax.

---
*** New function 'key-parse'.
This is like 'kbd', but only returns vectors instead of a mix of
vectors and strings.

+++
** New substitution in docstrings and 'substitute-command-keys'.
Use \\`KEYSEQ' to insert a literal key sequence "KEYSEQ" (for example
\\`C-k') in a docstring or when calling 'substitute-command-keys',
which will use the same face as a command substitution.  This should
be used only when a key sequence has no corresponding command, for
example when it is read directly with 'read-key-sequence'.  It must be
a valid key sequence according to 'key-valid-p'.

+++
** New function 'file-name-split'.
This returns a list of all the components of a file name.

+++
** New macro 'with-undo-amalgamate'.
It records a particular sequence of operations as a single undo step.

+++
** New command 'yank-media'.
This command supports yanking non-plain-text media like images and
HTML from other applications into Emacs.  It is only supported in
modes that have registered support for it, and only on capable
platforms.

+++
** New command 'yank-media-types'.
This command lets you examine all data in the current selection and
the clipboard, and insert it into the buffer.

+++
** New text property 'inhibit-isearch'.
If set, 'isearch' will skip these areas, which can be useful (for
instance) when covering huge amounts of data (that has no meaningful
searchable data, like image data) with a 'display' text property.

+++
** 'insert-image' now takes an INHIBIT-ISEARCH optional parameter.
It marks the image with the 'inhibit-isearch' text property, which
inhibits 'isearch' matching the STRING parameter.

---
** New user option 'pp-use-max-width'.
If non-nil, 'pp' will attempt to limit the line length when formatting
long lists and vectors.

---
** New function 'pp-emacs-lisp-code'.
'pp' formats general Lisp sexps.  This function does much the same,
but applies formatting rules appropriate for Emacs Lisp code.

+++
** New function 'file-has-changed-p'.
This convenience function is useful when writing code that parses
files at run-time, and allows Lisp programs to re-parse files only
when they have changed.

+++
** 'abbreviate-file-name' now respects magic file name handlers.

---
** New function 'font-has-char-p'.
This can be used to check whether a specific font has a glyph for a
character.

** XDG support

*** New function 'xdg-state-home' returns 'XDG_STATE_HOME' environment variable.
This new location, introduced in the XDG Base Directory Specification
version 0.8 (8th May 2021), "contains state data that should persist
between (application) restarts, but that is not important or portable
enough to the user that it should be stored in $XDG_DATA_HOME".

+++
** New macro 'with-delayed-message'.
This macro is like 'progn', but will output the specified message if
the body takes longer to execute than the specified timeout.

---
** New function 'funcall-with-delayed-message'.
This function is like 'funcall', but will output the specified message
if the function takes longer to execute than the specified timeout.

** Locale

---
*** New variable 'current-locale-environment'.
This holds the value of the previous call to 'set-locale-environment'.

---
*** New macro 'with-locale-environment'.
This macro can be used to change the locale temporarily while
executing code.

** Tabulated List Mode

+++
*** A column can now be set to an image descriptor.
The 'tabulated-list-entries' variable now supports using an image
descriptor, which means to insert an image in that column instead of
text.  See the documentation string of that variable for details.

+++
** :keys in 'menu-item' can now be a function.
If so, it is called whenever the menu is computed, and can be used to
calculate the keys dynamically.

+++
** New major mode 'clean-mode'.
This is a new major mode meant for debugging.  It kills absolutely all
local variables and removes overlays and text properties.

+++
** 'kill-all-local-variables' can now kill all local variables.
If given the new optional KILL-PERMANENT argument, also kill permanent
local variables.

+++
** Third 'mapconcat' argument SEPARATOR is now optional.
An explicit nil always meant the empty string, now it can be left out.

---
** Themes can now be made obsolete.
Using 'make-obsolete' on a theme is now supported.  This will make
'load-theme' issue a warning when loading the theme.

+++
** New function 'define-keymap'.
This function allows defining a number of keystrokes with one form.

+++
** New macro 'defvar-keymap'.
This macro allows defining keymap variables more conveniently.

---
** 'kbd' can now be used in built-in, preloaded libraries.
It no longer depends on edmacro.el and cl-lib.el.

+++
** New function 'image-at-point-p'.
This function returns t if point is on a valid image, and nil
otherwise.

+++
** New function 'string-pixel-width'.
This returns the width of a string in pixels.  This can be useful when
dealing with variable pitch fonts and glyphs that have widths that
aren't integer multiples of the default font.

+++
** New function 'string-glyph-split'.
This function splits a string into a list of strings representing
separate glyphs.  This takes into account combining characters and
grapheme clusters.

---
** 'lookup-key' is more permissive when searching for extended menu items.
In Emacs 28.1, the behavior of 'lookup-key' was changed: when looking
for a menu item '[menu-bar Foo-Bar]', first try to find an exact
match, then look for the lowercased '[menu-bar foo-bar]'.

This has been extended, so that when looking for a menu item with a
symbol containing spaces, as in '[menu-bar Foo\ Bar]', first look for
an exact match, then the lowercased '[menu-bar foo\ bar]' and finally
'[menu-bar foo-bar]'.  This further improves backwards-compatibility
when converting menus to use 'easy-menu-define'.

** xwidgets

+++
*** The function 'make-xwidget' now accepts an optional RELATED argument.
This argument is used as another widget for the newly created WebKit
widget to share settings and subprocesses with.  It must be another
WebKit widget.

+++
*** New function 'xwidget-perform-lispy-event'.
This function allows you to send events to xwidgets.  Usually, some
equivalent of the event will be sent, but there is no guarantee of
what the widget will actually receive.

On GTK+, only key and function key events are implemented.

+++
*** New function 'xwidget-webkit-load-html'.
This function is used to load HTML text into WebKit xwidgets
directly, in contrast to creating a temporary file to hold the
markup, and passing the URI of the file as an argument to
'xwidget-webkit-goto-uri'.

+++
*** New functions for performing searches on WebKit xwidgets.
Some new functions, such as 'xwidget-webkit-search', have been added
for performing searches on WebKit xwidgets.

+++
*** New function 'xwidget-webkit-back-forward-list'.
This function is used to obtain the history of page-loads in a given
WebKit xwidget.

+++
*** New function 'xwidget-webkit-estimated-load-progress'.
This function is used to obtain the estimated progress of page loading
in a given WebKit xwidget.

+++
*** New function 'xwidget-webkit-stop-loading'.
This function is used to terminate all data transfer during page loads
in a given WebKit xwidget.

+++
*** 'load-changed' xwidget events are now more detailed.
In particular, they can now have different arguments based on the
state of the WebKit widget.  'load-finished' is sent when a load has
completed, 'load-started' when a load first starts, 'load-redirected'
after a redirect, and 'load-committed' when the WebKit widget first
commits to the load.

+++
*** New event type 'xwidget-display-event'.
These events are sent whenever an xwidget requests that Emacs display
another xwidget.  The only arguments to this event are the xwidget
that should be displayed, and the xwidget that asked to display it.

+++
*** New function 'xwidget-webkit-set-cookie-storage-file'.
This function is used to control where and if an xwidget stores
cookies set by web pages on disk.

** New variable 'help-buffer-under-preparation'.
This variable is bound to t during the preparation of a "*Help*" buffer.


* Changes in Emacs 29.1 on Non-Free Operating Systems

** MS-Windows

+++
*** Emacs now supports system dark mode.
On Windows 10 (version 1809 and higher) and Windows 11, Emacs will now
follow the system's dark mode: GUI frames use the appropriate light or
dark title bar and scroll bars, based on the user's Windows-wide color
settings.
