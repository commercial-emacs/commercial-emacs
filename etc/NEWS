* Installation Changes in Emacs 29.1

** Emacs now installs the ".pdmp" file using a unique fingerprint in the name.
The file is typically installed using a file name akin to
"...dir/libexec/emacs/29.1/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/emacs-<fingerprint>.pdmp".
If a constant file name is required, the file can be renamed to
"emacs.pdmp", and Emacs will find it during startup anyway.


* Startup Changes in Emacs 29.1

+++
** Emacs now has a '--fingerprint' option.
This will output a string identifying the current Emacs build.

+++
** New hook 'after-pdump-load-hook'.
This is run at the end of the Emacs startup process, and it meant to
be used to reinitialize structures that would normally be done at load
time.


* Changes in Emacs 29.1

** Help

---
*** Jumping to function/variable source now saves mark before moving point.
Jumping to source from "*Help*" buffer moves the point when the source
buffer is already open.  Now, the old point is pushed to mark ring.


* Editing Changes in Emacs 29.1

---
** Indentation of 'cl-flet' and 'cl-labels' has changed.
These forms now indent like this:

    (cl-flet ((bla (x)
		(* x x)))
      (bla 42))

This change also affects 'cl-macrolet', 'cl-flet*' and
'cl-symbol-macrolet'.

+++
** New user option 'translate-upper-case-key-bindings'.
This can be set to nil to inhibit translating upper case keys to lower
case keys.

+++
** New command 'ensure-empty-lines'.
This command increases (or decreases) the number of empty lines before
point.

---
*** Improved mouse behavior with auto-scrolling modes.
When clicking inside the 'scroll-margin' or 'hscroll-margin' region
the point is now moved only when releasing the mouse button.  This no
longer results in a bogus selection, unless the mouse has been
effectively dragged.

+++
** 'kill-ring-max' now defaults to 120.

---
** New user option 'yank-menu-max-items'.
Customize this option to limit the amount of entries in the menu
"Edit->Paste from Kill Menu".  The default is 60.

** show-paren-mode

+++
*** New user option 'show-paren-context-when-offscreen'.
When non-nil, if the point is in a closing delimiter and the opening
delimiter is offscreen, shows some context around the opening
delimiter in the echo area.


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 29.1

** align

---
*** Alignment in 'text-mode' has changed.
Previously, 'M-x align' didn't do anything, and you have to say 'C-u
M-x align' for it to work.  This has now been changed.  The default
for regexp for 'C-u M-x align-regexp' has also been changed to be
easier for inexperienced users to use.

** eww

+++
*** New user option to automatically rename EWW buffers.
The 'eww-auto-rename-buffer' user option can be configured to rename
rendered web pages by using their title, URL, or a user-defined
function which returns a string.  For the first two cases, the length
of the resulting name is controlled by 'eww-buffer-name-length'.  By
default, no automatic renaming is performed.

** image-dired

---
*** New command for the thumbnail buffer.
The new command 'image-dired-unmark-all-marks' has been added with a
binding in the menu.

** info-look

---
*** info-look specs can now be expanded at run time instead of a load time.
The new ':doc-spec-function' element can be used to compute the
':doc-spec' element when the user asks for info on that particular
mode (instead of at load time).

** subr-x

+++
*** New macro 'with-memoization' provides a very primitive form of memoization.

** ansi-color

---
*** Support for ANSI 256-color and 24-bit colors.
256-color and 24-bit color codes are now handled by ANSI color
filters and displayed with the specified color.

** term-mode

---
*** Support for ANSI 256-color and 24-bit colors, italic and other fonts.
Term-mode can now display 256-color and 24-bit color codes.  It can
also handle ANSI codes for faint, italic and blinking text, displaying
it with new 'term-{faint,italic,slow-blink,fast-blink}' faces.

** Xref

*** 'project-find-file' and 'project-or-external-find-file' now accept
a prefix argument which is interpreted to mean "include all files".

** File notifications

+++
*** The new command 'file-notify-rm-all-watches' removes all file notifications.

** Sql

---
*** Sql now supports sending of passwords in-process.
To improve security, if an sql product has ':password-in-comint' set
to t, a password supplied via the minibuffer will be sent in-process,
as opposed to via the command-line.


* New Modes and Packages in Emacs 29.1

+++
** New mode 'erts-mode'.
This mode is used to edit files geared towards testing actions in
Emacs buffers, like indentation and the like.  The new ert function
'ert-test-erts-file' is used to parse these files.


* Incompatible Lisp Changes in Emacs 29.1

---
** 'downcase' details have changed slightly.
In certain locales, changing the case of an ASCII-range character may
turn it into a multibyte character, most notably with "I" in Turkish
(the lowercase is "Ä±", 0x0131).  Previously, 'downcase' on a unibyte
string was buggy, and would mistakenly just return the lower byte of
this, 0x31 (the digit "1").  'downcase' on a unibyte string has now
been changed to downcase such characters as if they were ASCII.  To
get proper locale-dependent downcasing, the string has to be converted
to multibyte first.  (This goes for the other case-changing functions,
too.)

---
** 'def' indentation changes.
In 'emacs-lisp-mode', forms with a symbol with a name that start with
"def" have been automatically indented as if they were 'defun'-like
forms, for instance:

    (defzot 1
      2 3)

This heuristic has now been removed, and all functions/macros that
want to be indented this way have to be marked with

    (declare (indent defun))

or the like.  If the function/macro definition itself can't be
changed, the indentation can also be adjusted by saying something
like:

    (put 'defzot 'lisp-indent-function 'defun)

---
** The 'inhibit-changing-match-data' variable is now obsolete.
Instead, functions like 'string-match' and 'looking-at' now take an
optional 'inhibit-modify' argument.

---
** 'gnus-define-keys' is now obsolete.
Use 'define-keymap' instead.

---
** MozRepl has been removed from js.el.
MozRepl was removed from Firefox in 2017, so this code doesn't work
with recent versions of Firefox.


* Lisp Changes in Emacs 29.1

+++
** 'define-key' now understands a new strict 'kbd' representation for keys.
The '(define-key map ["C-c M-f"] #'some-command)' syntax is now
supported, and is like the 'kbd' representation, but is stricter.  If
the string doesn't represent a valid key sequence, an error is
signalled (both when evaluating and byte compiling).

+++
** :keys in 'menu-item' can now be a function.
If so, it is called whenever the menu is computed, and can be used to
calculate the keys dynamically.

+++
** New major mode 'clean-mode'.
This is a new major mode meant for debugging.  It kills absolutely all
local variables and removes overlays and text properties.

+++
** 'kill-all-local-variables' can now kill all local variables.
If given the new optional KILL-PERMANENT argument, also kill permanent
local variables.

+++
** Third 'mapconcat' argument SEPARATOR is now optional.
An explicit nil always meant the empty string, now it can be left out.

---
** Themes can now be made obsolete.
Using 'make-obsolete' on a theme is now supported.  This will make
'load-theme' issue a warning when loading the theme.

+++
** New function 'define-keymap'.
This function allows defining a number of keystrokes with one form.

+++
** New macro 'defvar-keymap'.
This macro allows defining keymap variables more conveniently.

---
** 'kbd' can now be used in built-in, preloaded libraries.
It no longer depends on edmacro.el and cl-lib.el.

+++
** New function 'kbd-valid-p'.
The 'kbd' function is quite permissive, and will try to return
something usable even if the syntax of the argument isn't completely
correct.  The 'kbd-valid-p' predicate does a stricter check of the
syntax.
