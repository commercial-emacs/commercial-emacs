* Installation Changes in Emacs 30.1


* Startup Changes in Emacs 30.1


* Changes in Emacs 30.1

** X selection requests are now handled much faster and asynchronously.
This means it should be less necessary to disable the likes of
`select-active-regions' when Emacs is running over a slow network
connection.


* Editing Changes in Emacs 30.1


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 30.1
---
** Variable order and truncation can now be configured in gdb-many-window mode.
The new variable 'gdb-locals-table-row-config' allows users to
configure the order and max length of various properties in the local
variables buffer when using 'gdb-many-windows'.

By default, this variable is set to write the properties in the order:
name, type and value, where the name and type are truncated to 20
characters, and the value is truncated according to the value of
'gdb-locals-value-limit'.

If you want to get back the old behavior, set
'gdb-locals-table-row-config' to  the value

  ((type . 0)(name . 0)(value . ,gdb-locals-value-limit)).

** VC

---
*** New user option 'vc-git-shortlog-switches'.
This is a string or a list of strings that specifies the Git log
switches for shortlogs, such as the one produced by 'C-x v L'.
'vc-git-log-switches' is no longer used for shortlogs.

** bs

---
*** New user option 'bs-default-action-list'.
You can now configure how to display the "*buffer-selection*" buffer
using this new option.  (Or set 'display-buffer-alist' directly.)

+++
*** 'eshell-read-aliases-list' is now an interactive command.
After manually editing 'eshell-aliases-file', you can use
'M-x eshell-read-aliases-list' to load the edited aliases.


* New Modes and Packages in Emacs 30.1

** New major mode 'dockerfile-ts-mode'.
A major mode based on the tree-sitter library for editing
Dockerfiles.  It includes support for font-locking, indentation, Imenu,
and which-func.
