## Frequently Anticipated Questions

### Why?

This is the oft ideated, never sublimated "forge" repository for
emacs.  As it is hosted on a site using
[non-free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.en.html)
software, the work herein is not the official GNU Emacs source, and
does not entreat the FSF to enforce its license.

### How to build?

```
git clone https://github.com/commercial-emacs/commercial-emacs.git
cd commercial-emacs
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
make -j4
src/emacs
```

The `make` logic remains broken in the sense that frequently,
incompatible artifacts from a previous build do not get rebuilt.
Preceding the above with,

```
git clean -dfX
```

rebuilds from scratch.

### How often are you merging commits from GNU?

Roughly every hour.

### How has the code diverged thus far?

- Performant long lines.
- [Tree-sitter font highlighting](#tree-sitter). <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>
- Gnus is rewritten to be non-blocking.
- Process management is rewritten.
- Tree-sitter replacement of ersatz PPSS syntactic parser.
- [Moving garbage collector rudiments](#moving-collector).

### <a name="tree-sitter"></a>How can I try tree-sitter highlighting?

Install Rust library:
```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch 0.6.3alpha5 \
  https://github.com/commercial-emacs/tree-sitter.git
make -C tree-sitter install
pkg-config --exact-version=0.6.3alpha5 tree-sitter || echo not found
```

Then build emacs:
```bash
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local --with-tree-sitter
make -j4
ldd src/emacs | grep -q tree-sitter || echo not found
make test/src/tree-sitter-tests
src/emacs -Q --eval \
  "(custom-set-variables '(font-lock-support-mode 'tree-sitter-lock-mode))" \
  --visit src/xdisp.c
```

### <a name="moving-collector"></a>What is a moving garbage collector?

Moving collectors relocate Lisp values in memory, in contrast to the
GNU Emacs collector, which upon allocating say a cons cell, will let
it remain at its birth address in perpetuity.

GNU Emacs's mark-sweep-free-list collector has been unfairly maligned,
generally by undergraduates who just implemented a toy moving
collector for their PL class.  They might be surprised to know that
the Cheney moving collector predates Emacs's Boehm collector by twenty
years.

But one thing moving collectors can do that non-moving ones can't is
*generational* sequestration, that is, keeping the youngest cohort of
Lisp values separated from older ones.  This allows faster
intermediary mark phases which only collect the "nursery" generation.
A non-moving collector must traverse the full set on each cycle since
its allocations are interleaved.

### Isn't this xemacs all over again?

Ah, but if it could reach those heights.  If by some miracle it did,
the choices for the FSF are the same as before: enlist RMS to embark
on a coding frenzy that achieves feature parity, grant myself commit
rights, or continue not noticing me.  If my history of user
acquisition is any indication, the last outcome is most likely.
