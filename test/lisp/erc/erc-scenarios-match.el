;; This defends against a regression in which all matching by the
;; `erc-match-message' fails when `erc-add-timestamp' precedes it in
;; `erc-insert-modify-hook'.  Basically, `erc-match-message' used to
;; expect an `erc-parsed' text property on the first character in a
;; message, which doesn't exist, when the message content is prefixed
;; by a leading timestamp.
