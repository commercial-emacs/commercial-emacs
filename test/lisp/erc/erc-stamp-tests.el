;; This concerns a proposed partial reversal of the changes resulting
;; from:
;;
;;   24.1.50; Wrong behavior of move-end-of-line in ERC (Bug#11706)
;;
;; Perhaps core behavior has changed since this bug was reported, but
;; C-e stopping one char short of EOL no longer seems a problem.
;; However, invoking C-n (`next-line') exhibits a similar effect.
;; When point is in a stamp or near the beginning of a line, issuing a
;; C-n puts point one past the start of the message (i.e., two chars
;; beyond the timestamp's closing "]".  Dropping the invisible
;; property when timestamps are hidden does indeed prevent this, but
;; it's also a lasting commitment.  The docs mention that it's
;; pointless to pair the old `intangible' property with `invisible'
;; and suggest users look at `cursor-intangible-mode'.  Turning off
;; the latter does indeed do the trick as does decrementing the end of
;; the `cursor-intangible' interval so that, in addition to C-n
;; working, a C-f from before the timestamp doesn't overshoot.  This
;; appears to be the case whether `erc-hide-timestamps' is enabled or
;; not, but it may be inadvisable for some reason (a hack) and
;; therefore warrants further investigation.
;;
;; Note some striking omissions here:
;;
;;   1. a lack of `fill' module integration (we simulate it by
;;      making lines short enough to not wrap)
;;   2. functions like `line-move' behave differently when
;;      `noninteractive'
;;   3. no actual test assertions involving `cursor-sensor' movement
;;      even though that's a huge ingredient
